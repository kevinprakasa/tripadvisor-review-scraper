This beach is beautiful and well worth a nice chill out, but becareful of the sun lounger “owners” we got fleeced every time and we still don’t know who owns the bloody things !! The beach is full of locals / immigrants who constantly Harrass you to purchase from them. Most are pleasant but some can be really quite rude and pushy to the point where they sat with us and wouldn’t leave and commented your young you have money help us out. I wouldn’t go back to the beach purely because we went twice the level of hassasment each time meant we just couldn’t relax. However we went to jimbaran beach and there was none of that so out of the two although more picturesque I wouldn’t go back to kuta beach

This is an ideal beach for surfers. Even for those who are in the learning stage, due to the lots of instructors available there. The white sand is nice for sunbathing. And above all watch the exotic sunset here. Better ask for the prices before buying drinks etc ,which are mostly above average.

This is the closest beach to our hotel, but it wasn't the first one we've visited. We went there planning to rent surf instructors and were quickly approached by many people offering the instructions and boards.. it is mandatory to bargain with them, and we paid about 30€ an hour for the three of us, which I think is really good. The only bad thing is the fact that there are a lot of people who offer you other stuff to buy (bracelets, bow&arrows, etc) and they are very persistent.

Kuta beach is so nice, although there are no sun beds you can buy a mat to sit or lay on on the beach. I’m not really a beach person but enjoyed the time we spent there.

Feel like too commercial as a lot of people trying to get you to have join surfing course. To buy their drinks/ coconuts.
To sit on the beach chair with some fees.

What I want is just have a nice and quiet walk.

But overall, this is best place for surfing activity
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,1,30>===============  
I had been expecting Kuta beach to be a lot more crowded than it actually was so I was pleasantly surprised to find a fairly quiet stretch of beach, although this may have something to so with the fact that it wasn't the Australian school holidays when we visited.

It was gorgeous to walk along with our feet in the warm Indian Ocean. As expected, we were approached several times by various surf teachers/bar owners/trinket sellers, but a polite 'no thank you' and a smile was enough... Unless you are sat down, then they tend to gather round you and are a lot more pushy and persistent. It becomes very annoying very quickly when they won't take no for an answer.

Kuta beach is well known for beginners surfing, although I doubt the waves would be enough to challenge a more experienced surfer. Along almost the full length of the beach are surf instructors and it's a very popular tourist activity. It's a very gentle, easy place to practice the basics and my even daughter- who has been surfing for a while- really enjoyed herself messing around on the non taxing waves.

Just a tip; If you walk along and ask the different people who approach you for prices, you should expect to pay maximum 200kIDR. We were quoted as high as 450k but ended up paying just 150k, so it's worth asking around. You don't have to approach them, they will come to you. 200k should get you 2 hours in the water and 30 mins on land training.

It is a nice beach and a bit of a break from the crazy, fun winding streets of Kuta.
The only negative I can really say is that as there is quite a bit of plastic in the ocean as you walk through the shallows. Hopefully the amazing people at 4ocean get there soon.

Too bad it’s such a beautiful beach with amazing sunsets, but the pushy locals are ruining it!
This whole Kuta area needs a strict president like the Filipino president Duterte!
The Indonesian government really needs to crack down on the taxis and the hustlers here. Otherwise, there won’t be many tourists interested in Kuta.

Kuta Beach is just other popular beaches which is frequented by tourists and locals. It is also liked by surfers and water sports enthusiasts. There are lots of happenings on the beach and people can enjoy sunbathing, swimming ......never a dull moment. Neverlessnres one thing that cannot be missed is the wonderful sunset. The bright big orange appears right in front of u.... watching it slowly submerged in the horizon... just beautiful and peaceful. At the same time I just help it to notice that people love selfies...

It was a memorable moment
U feel peaceful if u focus on the sunset
U feel the energy if u focus on the hassle buzzle of people shouting and clicking their cameras...

Anyway sunset can remind us of the impermanence and the nature..but it also reminds us of a new day will come tomorrow after the sunset....

This beach is very CROWDED! This public beach is near all the tourist hotels and airbnbs and it's just very hectic during the day. So many people trying to sell you things and many people trying to learn how to surf. So if you're looking for a peaceful beach this is not it. But you if you do want to learn how to surf or just watch people surf, this is the place to visit.

please buy a few items from these people it wont break the bank.
the best thing you can do is ask them a few questions about them and their family very interesting buy them an ice block or a drink they will look after you ten fold, they will keep others away and let you relax. its great to learn a few things about their culture, happy surfing, lessons on the beach only cost $20 for a couple of hours one on one. remember have fun.

This review is difficult, long stretch of sand however in terms of beauty I question. Not a swimming beach as populated with surfing. Great for an early/late run but hugely polluted with tourist plastic. Plenty of sun beds to rent and drink shacks which can also deliver local food for 40,000 and a small beer for 30,000. I can only commend the beach cleaning team for a relentless job. Better beaches in SEA.

Everybody speaks highly of Bali's Kuta beach, but I honestly don't find anything special about it. I've been to far more beautiful beaches in Asia with fine white sand, crystalline eaters, long line up of palm trees, etc. ... all the stuff that you expect to find in a tropical beach. Kuta beach has none of all of these! Perhaps the only thing nice about it are the shops, the restaurants and the souvenir shops facing the beach. But if you're after a good dip, I suggest that you go somewhere else.

My family enjoyed several days on Kuta Beach. The beach was relaxing and we especially liked the sunsets. We did not like that there was so many hustlers trying to sell us a product or provide a service. It really turned us off. We did not expect them to be so pushy on the beach as they are at the market. Everything that sold at the beach is overpriced.

This beach is filled with plastics, see the picture I took. It’s not coïncidental, i’s like this every day pretty much throughout the whole beach.
Locals and tourist just drop the plastics on the sand, partially because there are no decent waste bins.
The whole beach is covered with it.

Best to stay away from this beach and go to Seminyak or even better Jimbaran bay. These beaches are not flawless when it comes to plastics but are much much cleaner.
Hope the guys and girls from 4ocean.com (cleaning up the ocean and beaches - located on Bali) can help stop this extreme polution.

Kuta beach is located at the city centre, with almost circular beach line, perfect to have a Bintang, and enjoying the sunset. Waves are high, so better for surfing compared to swimming.

If you decided to get to know what is surfing about and you are completely new in this adorable sport, than you must visit Kuta Beach. During our stay in Bali we tried different spots, and Kuta is definitely the best beach to start surfing.

I am staying down south a bit but wanted to check out this beach. The sand is covered in trash and plastic wrapped around my ankles in the ocean. The people are like any other similar beach tourist area hassling you to buy something but the surf companies at least took my first no as an answer. The chairs and umbrellas are owned by locals so you’ll need to pay and honestly I’ve traveled to many counties (including Asian ones) this is the worst beach I have ever seen...

It’s is a very busy beach, there is a sea of humanity and this inhuman sea of people leave garbage everywhere. The locals were at it cleaning but apparently not fast enough. Nice big waves, lot of eating joints and sports but the place was too crowded to be fun for us.

The pictures say it all. For the No. 1 party destination this is disgraceful. My Son asked that we get off the beach as he was saddened by the amount he f rubbish to walk through.

Kuta is a really diverse place, from the big streets with the shopping malls to the small secluded lanes like Poppies. I really like Poppies, but not much of the other Kuta. The Beach is really nice but also not a place to be if you want to be alone. Love the small stalls all over, but missing more food options.

After being told by several different people sunset at Kuta beach is a must, we arrived an hour before to find the atmosphere really buzzing, with people of all ages seated on plastic chairs in any available space with little mini “bars” where you could buy beer, spirits, soft drinks etc. Hustling among the crowds were Balinese trying to sell the usual watches, handbags, massages etc. The sunset was really beautiful and overall it was good to experience, the atmosphere was alive and the crowd out to enjoy and have a good time.

Kuta is a must see in Bali even though it is by no means an amazing spot. If you want to learn to surf this is an excellent spot. Do be careful and watch for the warning flags. There are strong rip tides and people do drown here often. For me the best thing about Kuta is having a beer at sunset at one of the beach bars which are nothing more than some plastic chairs and a beer crate for a table, perfect. Great sunset almost everyday.

This is a lovely beach. But be aware, as soon as you hit the sand the locals are on you straight away. This was a bit too much for me but then when I politely declined about 10 people they sort of got the message. The beach itself was lovely and clean, and the water beautifully clear. It’s lovely for an early morning walk or to watch as the sun goes down. The locals had set up little stalls at the top of the beach selling arts and crafts as well as coconut and fruit juices. Just remember to say no ice as they don’t use bottled water for the ice and this could lead to illness very quickly.

Kuta, is ones famous place in the world. Located in Badung regency, Bali, Indonesia. Kuta have nice beaches for swim and of course for surfing also, the wave in very good for learning how to surf, so a lot of surf schools around and mostly along the beaches. In Kuta beach also people so release the baby turtles, not every day but 3 times a week usually.

We spent one day along the beach. Parked up scooter across the road from the Hard Rock Cafe. Waves are slightly bigger than that along Seminyak beach. Alot of local surf instructors along this beach though. Be wary of the odd local who claims to know you from a previous encounter. Walk away as they try to tempt tourist into buying drugs of them. They use an aggressive sale tactic to befriend you before they try to lead you down a garden path. Again the beach is nice...

Kuta beach is clean and tidy with a long walk possible right to the wall of the airport on one side. There are many hotels and resorts along the beach and also a shopping mall. Proximity to the airport is an added advantage but have to travel northwards 2-3 hours for other adventure activities. Good full day tours available within 40-75 USD including hot springs and waterfall as well as a 2 hour river rafting, which includes pick up and drop with lunch and insurance. Lot of good seafood available here at small shacks along the beach towards hard rock cafe and hotel.

This beach is nothing more than a regular beach you might find in your city or next to yours. The only reason you may have to visit this is the crowd in the evening and stalls around this place. As many hotels/restaurants are very near to this beach, this beach is always full. Being in Bali and spending more than 1 hour of your quality time on this beach ain't recommended.

if you like to party and a lot of people this is your place but for my taste, way too much people on this beach and boardwalk. very noisy, too much drinking and partying and a lot of sellers on the beach very aggressive at their selling pushin and pushing and just not leaving you alone one after the other. sunset was gorgeous but just too much of everything on the beach, but beach is very large for kids and familys to play on

This beach is perfect if your a first time or pro surfer, it offers waves throughout the day for both!!
Across the beach surf boards and body boards are available at reasonable prices.
Not much room for swimmers for great for jumping around in the waves.
Close food and shops near by for when you need a break from the sun, sea and sand.

This is a good beach to learn to surf. You rent a board and some instructor to teach the fundamentals to paddle and balance on the board. Then off you go chasing the waves.
The waves can be strong at times and then the water calms down again. It is not great for swimming in because of the waves, but you can dip in to get wet.

Please think twice about taking the horse and cart ride in Kuta!!! We were there a week ago and I was horrified at the poor condition of these horses. Thirty-degree heat and the horses had no shade whatsoever...whilst the two drivers/owners were well and truly in the shade. The horses were extremely skinny, frothing at the mouth due to dehydration and their body language was heartbreaking. They have been well and truly broken. I tried to speak to the owner, but he wasn't remotely interested. As I couldn't stop thinking about them, I contacted BAWA - animal welfare in Bali. Unfortunately not much can be done due to poor animal welfare laws in Bali. The only way people can vote is with their money. It would be heartwarming to see more people refusing to partake in this terrible sideshow. Thanks.

Went with my friends from Ubud as we wanna surf!

It was my first time to try surfing and it was really fun and challenging. We just picked up one of the surfing company aside the beach and after a little of bargaining then they provide us 2 instructors with 2 hours surfing board usage. They will teach you at the first hour and the second hour will let you free style. Haha! If you are a fast learner then it not necessary for them to teach you exactly an hour.

Public toilet is available. You will need to pay at different price for changing only or shower. Bring your towel, shampoo, shower gel etc as they are not providing nor selling there.

If you have time, take your time and sit on the beach for the sunset. A quick one but it’s really amazing and nice!

Give a try on surfing and I love surfing now ❣️

I went for a walk to the beach. The sand was nice and there is always someone at the entrances cleaning up any rubbish and leaves. Went and sat on a beach chair, but found out the seats are only for people buying drinks etc. So beware. You do get hassled a lot at the beach for manicures etc.

Beautiful beach with clean golden sands. Hire a sunbed or just take your towel and laze away a few hours. There are people selling drinks and ice creams and fruit on the beach but there are also vendors selling scarves, etc, offering massages etc that can get annoying but a polite no and they walk on.
The sea can be choppy which is why the many surfers love it and watching them is interesting. The beach is wide and the tide does come in and out fairly quickly. There is always room to get a space without having to be crowded. There are some toilets - not brilliant - and showers which they charge a small amount for. Just across the road are lots or shops, bars and restuarants so food is never far.

After snorkeling,we tried to learn surfing at Kuta Beach. There are a lot of foreigners at this beach and lots of people learn surfing here. The coaches are young in general and it's better you know how to swim. This will definitely do you good.
You can see tide waves if you are tired. The fee is cheap,3 people 2 hours 400RMB, so be careful and don't get cheated.

I think we have been spoilt by the beaches in Thailand compared to them beaches the ones in Bali aren’t great, the sand isn’t white like you see on most photos most of them have been photoshopped, the sea is quite rough good for surfing and you can get cold bintangs and surfing lessons from pretty much everywhere on the beach. There are also a LOT of hawkers who just don’t leave you alone!! Good for watching the sunset though.

As you walk onto the beach, you are greeted with a gorgeous view, a long beach stretching out. The downside is there are the usual people hassling you as you walk down, trying to sell you trinkets, surf lessons, and drinks.
There are trees where you can find shade from the sun, at the rear of the beach, however with all the small bars lining the way it is hard to appreciate the view from here.
Also, it is almost impossible to walk into the sea, and sharp shells and large rocks lie everywhere in the sand, and the water is not clear, making it easy to cut yourself if you did want to swim.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,13,40>===============  
Very nice view and beautiful beach. However it is always crowded and mostly with surfers "beginners" a good place to learn surfing with mid waves. But I did not see any lifeguard there and its not a relaxing beach at all.

Great beach - nice sands and good water. Very picturesque.

However - street vendors are everywhere trying to sell you stuff and obviously as this is a main tourist spot, the beach packed with Aussies. Not sure it would be an particularly good beach for families as the water was rough and got deep quickly. Ideal for the hundreds of amateur surfers present, but not so much anyone else.

To note: You have to pay to use the chairs/beds on the beach. Prices vary.

Didn’t go swimming and bit busy for me but it’s iconic. Normal sarong hawkers etc. busy road to cross to get there, but follow a local or a surfer and you’ve right. Sometimes there police further up to stop traffic so you can cross. Fellow guests had massages on beach for $5, said really good. Look fir lady in blue hat with MADE on it.

This was our first visit to Bali and,in fairness, we took notice of people's opinions who've been, when maybe we shouldnt have. If we hadn't then we would have stayed in Legian or Seminyak. I wish we had.
We visited Sanur and Ubud prior to Kuta, both of which were wonderful.
We're 58 and 62 and pretty lively. We like to socialise and have a good time in the evenings. Unfortunately,unless you're a group of youngsters or part of a big Australian group of family or friends,that doesnt really work.
Kuta has been taken over by the multi nationals, with prices to match.
Food is ok but the same menu almost everywhere. When we did try the small Warungs off the main drag the food and drinks where almost the same. Just poorer facilities.
If you're Ozzie this place is cheap, if you're from the U.K., its not.
I can buy large Bintang cheaper in England than Kuta.
I described Kuta to my Oz based son as Blackpool on steroids but without Blackpools class. He thought that was hilarious. I thought it was pretty accurate. Lovely people here and you are always being surprised by the temples you stumble across.
But really, we could have gone to Benidorm and saved ourselves 14 of the 17 hour flights, each way.
Just the wrong resort for us. Our fault not Kuta's. You live and learn.

Visited this beach a few times while I was in Kuta, both during the day and a few times at sunset.

The beach itself is pretty but it’s not amazing. Definitely recommend visiting for sunset. It is very over crowded with tourists and people trying to sell you things (eg, towels, throws, drinks, taxis, hair braiding) and trying to get you to pay to hire a day bed. The people are very persistent and it can become annoying if you’re just trying to relax.

From the moment we stepped into the beach, we were amazed. The beach was very clean with soft, sinking sand underneath our feet. We sat at a lounge chair and a guy approached us saying he was renting the chairs for 100k. We didn't know it was for rent and assumed it was for free but it was 2 hours till sunset and the price was really cheap. The guy took care of us, recommending a surf lesson and water for very cheap prices. The waves can get rough. But the view of the sunset was gorgeous. I would recommend this place.

Kuta is famous for its nightlife and the beach is pretty average. It can surely be given a miss. As soon as you enter the beach you are surrounded by vendors selling you something or the other - from local tours to massages to hats, sarongs etc. The beach is very crowded and you can see a lot of people surfing there. if you are looking for a quiet escape, this is surely not a place to go.

After checked out from the hotel, i left my luggage under the hotel supervision to hang out at Kuta Beach before my flight that night. During my visit to Bali i was in Uluwatu watching the sufers at the Blue Point Beach but i never swim in the sea.The beach in Kuta was great. Its a bit crowded but you can fine your own personal spot to hang out. I parked my rental scooter at the motorbike parking. Its look full but there will be parking staff to help finding space to park. There will be lots of seller selling things but just say no thank you and they will walk away. There is lots of plastic chair under the tree shadow to hang out but you need to buy the drinks. A beer will cost 30000idr. Not bad at all. Than the guy who run the place approach me and ask weather i would like to learn suring. HIs name is Indra Aditya.His place located opposite the big billboard in front of the Kuta Beachwalk Shopping mall. I would like to learn surfing very much during my visit but i just never have a chance yet. After persuaded by him, he said 'your visit to Bali is not complete of perfect without surfing'. I finally agreed. I paid 250k idr for a session including renting the swimming trunk, shirt (i didnt bring it) and surf board. The water is a bit chill and the waves were quite big with strong currents.There were beach guard who will blow the whistle to warn swimmer about the strong current. As the sun was hot combine with the chill sea water, it was perfect and enjoyable sesssion. The first wave i ride was really satisfying after few failed attempt. The whole session was about 2 hours. Thanks to him who successfully persuaded me and i finally surf for the first time in my life. Than during break, i bought food at the warung nearby. It is cheap and tasty. After changed back to my dry clothes, I closed my visit to Bali by watching sunset while drinking beers. Than i quickly went back to the Hotel to pick up my luggage and sent my rented scooter to the owners and got sent by them to the airport. Thank you Bali the island of GOD.

Kuta Beach has always been a pretty hectic place - lots of noise and activity. The highlight this trip was participating in the baby turtle release through the turtle conservation group at the beach, which takes place around 4pm most days (look for the giant turtle across from the sand).

Look, I'm not a picky person or get annoyed easy, but this beach is annoying! For starters, you'll get approached every 2 min with someone wanting to sell you something or a lady asking you if you want a massage. Its nonstop! I started speaking Spanish so they could just leave us alone quickly lol. The beach is full of people. Lots of drunk people. And the beach sand is rough. My Bali trip almost got ruined by coming here, until I discovered Seminyka beach. Much much much better! Kuta reminds me of when I was 18 yrs old going to Tijuana and partying all night type of place. If you like awful food, lots of people, trashy atmosphere, then this place is right for you

Lovely beach if you get a bit closer to the water as there were a lot of people hassling you to buy things and offering free tickets to scratch and win only to find it was a time share thing .. wear reef shoes or similar as the sand is made up of a lot of sharp shells.

The locals have already secured the shade under trees so will charge you to sit on their chairs and tbh its the only shadey place on the beach. A little annoying but for £1 a bottle of beer on the beach cant really complain. Very rough sea - must be a god swimmer or you will get knocked over. Rent a body board - great fun safer down towards the bottom end of the beach by discovery supermarket - the far end is big waves and lots of spray making the beach look misty! Very busy at turtle release time 4pm and sunset - lovely clean beach. Large drops as you head out into the water. Near the water is hard coral and shells but the minute you get into the water turns to sand. No shoes needed just painful when walking back up the beach for 20seconds

Kuta beach is said to be very crowded as many surfers seek the place for the best wave.
I found it much more relaxed and quiet then for example Miami Beach or Barcelona beach although it has a bit of that flair. We rented sun beds for the entire day (very cheap) and they kept them for us while we went out for lunch.

Beers at the beach, locals to teach you surfing and really cool and fun waves even if you don’t surf.

Alot is going on here! You can hire a lounger at one of the many beach bars on this vast beach, it will come with a much needed umbrella and the bar staff will take good care of you. They will bring you drinks of any description and food. They kindly provide you with a bucket of water to wash your feet in, so you can avoid getting sand on your towel/lounger. Recommend you take a towel with you. Ladies are strolling up and down the beach offering hair braiding, pedicures/manicures, massages. Lots of hawkers!

We walked to Kuta beach from our hotel. It was such fun to walk vendors and sit on plastic chairs having tonic water (they sell all types of beverages, alcohol, etc.) and chat with other tourists. The beach was very clean and many people were surfing! We prefer the sugar white beaches of the Caribbean and some white beaches of Thailand and Malaysia. Flores and Komodo have some white and pink beaches which are beautiful. Kuta has golden sands, but clean. Vendors did not hassle us. It was quite relaxing.

Full of tourists, crazy honking from motos and cars, stressed out horses that have nothing to do there, locals hazling you to buy their stuff or eat at their place! Kuta is the absolute worst destination in Bali. Plus, the beach is dirty, we picked up several plastics and rubbish with my boyfriend to help the poor beach. The worst are the hoards of tourists who are loud and just make this place awful for a relaxing vacation.

We only stayed in Kuta for 2 nights after a cruise which frankly was 2 nights too many. It reminded me of Falaraki, Magaluf and Lloret de Mar in the 1970's and 80's all rolled into one. Every other shop is a tattoo parlour and the others all sell tacky T-shirts. The beach is overcrowded and full of touts. The place is over run by Aussies on low budget holidays swigging beer in the street with various body parts wrapped in clingfilm after they've had yet another tattoo. It's a shame as the hotel we stayed in, 4 Points by Sheraton, was thankfully very nice as after a look round the "resort" on day one, we didn't bother going out again.
I'm afraid Kuta is best avoided unless this type of holiday appeals to you.

Is a nice place where you can practice surf. The lessons are at a good price a big minus is that is very busy beach.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,17,30>===============  
Unfortunately, the lovely beaches of Kuta are overrun with touts with their aggressive sales tactics. The moment you step through the short wall barrier, you will be besieged by people asking you to surf, have a drink or a seat at their areas - totally offputting.

Once you get past that however, there is a nice beach with decent waves for surfing.

I feel it is unfair to penalize this location as an attraction, however as a regular to Bali, I would not come here. There are other beaches that are equally beautiful and more peaceful without compromising amenities/services.

Been to Kuta in October 2017 and July 2018 and both times spent several days on Kuta beach. Marry's (Mary's) bar is where we spent our time on the beach, great value for beds, drink, anything you need they will source it for you. Great wee place. You have people trying to sell you things but they are all very nice people and don't force things on you, if you say no they just keep walking. Great beach to relax really enjoyed it.

Me and my 2 friends had a lovely afternoon on Kuta Beach. There are plenty of restaurants with fantastic beach views that we were able to choose from for lunch (we chose The Boardwalk). The waves were great (if you like big waves that is), the surfers were enjoying them, and so were regular swimmers such as ourselves.

Maybe we were lucky with the section of beach we chose but we did not find it to be overrun by tourists as other reviews have implied, we had plenty of space, both on the beach and in the sea.

At the end of the day, a beach is a beach, but this is a particularly nice one (a good reason for its fame in the region).

You have to take it for what it is. A tourist attraction. Nice to go for a beer in the afternoon, expect to get harassed by peddlers, and businesses wanting you to sit at their chairs. Once settled, keep the beers coming or you'll have to move.

Kuta beach had a nice atmosphere. In the shady part you'll find people trying to sell drinks, massage, souvenirs. I had my drinks at Mr. Lucky's place and sat there in the shade for more than 2 hours without constantly being hassled. For sunbathing the beach is nice if you don't need beds and umbrella's and you are OK with sunbathing on a towel. Our daughters took surflessons from one of the guys at the beach (rp 200.000 for 1 hour private lesson and 1 hour surfing on your own). Kuta beach is a good beach for beginners! White sand (the sand texture is not very fine).

We came to the beach for a day of fun. We have 3 kids 2 of which wanted to learn to surf. We found a lovely bloke who taught them and who we hired the boards off. He was brilliant sorry don’t know his name but there are a few of them on the beach.
The beach isn’t really sandy either I really wish I had water shoes as it’s very grainy and sharp in places.
Also be on the look out for dog poo and glass in the sand as that was a big let down for me.
Overall not bad beach but could be better ideal to spend a few hours there

Stayed at the Padma resort which backs onto the beach. Great hotel and position.
The beach is clean and tidy.
It is lined with food and drink stalls. For the Aussies reading this, one is called Ketut and Rhonda, named after the TV add using these names.
All offered bean bags or bean bag style seats and umbrellas for shade. The sun sets over the water, so the afternoons have sun in your face and therefore umbrellas can shade you if you are turning into a lobster.
A few touts around but the move on quickly if given a polite no thanks accompanied by a shake of the head.

Although we only strolled part of the beach, it has much improved since last here. There is still rubbish in some areas but certainly more clean sand sighted. Sun lounges and umbrellas abound and you are continually hassled to 'rent' one for the day. Plenty of locals touting their services to teach swimming or surfing. Not as many hawkers encountered as previously. Get off the beach and cross the road to many tourist outlets.

I just arrived at our hotel after a stressful 3 hour trip from Singaraja and decided to go to the beach.
I decided to go for a walk on the beach good idea,the sun had lost some of its heat the path was busy with waves were small the sand was clean I walked on the path it was busy with Tourists People bikes and Balinese trying to make a living.

I had a cold beer and a chair overlooking the ocean for 25,000 ruhpia ($2.50) great value.
At 4.30 pm lots of people were involved in releasing baby turtles into the ocean ,what a wonderful idea to get the message of conservation across
I really enjoyed Kuta Beach

Black Henna is not Henna. Natural Henna should be a reddish brown color. If it's black it contains PPD. Both of my boys had them done on the beach and now 3 weeks later it is still blistering. I'm praying it's not going to scar but I'm reading some very scary stories about it. The Indonesian Government is doing nothing to regulate this. Don't Get Black Henna.

This beach has so much potential, it’s just a shame to see plastic scattered everywhere that’s either been washed up along the coast or deliberately littered by tourists. Furthermore every 5 minuets the locals will approach and try to sell you either drinks or surf lessons.
If you want a clean, surf friendly beach then I suggest driving 20mins up the west coast to Canggu or Seminyak P.s the sunset by “Old Mans” Bar is grand!

The beach is walkable during lower tides but the water starts coming up around 11. Lots most of the beach around that time.
The waves are great for surfing. Strong tide though so if you try to go for a swim, there’s a chance you’ll get knocked down.
Lots of people walking and the water looks nice on a sunny day (everyday we’ve been here).
Tide goes back down during sunset time.
Worth the visit to watch some surf and sunset but watch out for small children and the waves.

A visit to Kuta Beach is a must.
Go down late afternoon to take in the sunset. You will find thousands of people on the beach at this time.
Whether you just want to wander along the beach or go sit in a Bean bag/table at one of the numerous little bars under their umbrellas that's all part of it.
The drinks are cheap so is the seating but what the H...
Its a lovely way to spend the evening.
Only one thing you will get lots of hawkers selling their goods coming up to you.
If you stop one you will have half a dozen around you in no time.

Having read many reviews about this resort, I was quite apprehensive about going. Having spent six days in Singapore I was expecting the Wild West.
I read reviews about beer being thrown at pedestrians by drunken idiots. People being chased from toilets for not paying. So having my wife and daughter with me I was quite concerned

However, when I got there it was the total opposite of what I read. Security is very strong bag searches going into bars and malls was customary. As for walking along the beach there are hundreds of hawkers offering bloody cold beer mate. But a simple no thank you was enough. Never once was I chased or pestered.
As for the beach it was not the best I have ever been on but it certainly wasn’t the worst. And fair play to the local hawkers they were all raking the sand around their pitches to keep the area clean. As for the comment by someone who was supposedly chased after using the toilet facilities, there are signs saying there is a small charge for using them, wether licensed or from their own initiative I’m not sure. However the cost is minimal and the toilets quite clean.
I stayed at the Bali garden beach resort and read reviews about Aussies bring beer into breakfast and using foul language. Never once did I observe this. Yes they were loud but very family orientated. And being a Welshman had some good conversations about rugby. Also heard bad reports of bagus watches were they sell fake watches as an owner of a Rolex I compared mine to the fakes. The quality of them are excellent you couldn’t tell the difference. Please give Bali a go it’s not for everyone but I enjoyed it and I have stayed in five star hotels all over the world. The people are friendly and do tout for business. But no more than any other tourist trap. I was there in July 2018 when the earthquake struck so I would like to offer my condolences to all the people that lost loved ones. When you have been in that environment when it happened it brings out the best in people just looking to help those that got injured

Really clean and cool to watch the sunset. The only problem is the amount of tourists around which brings you every meters sellers asking you for something to buy or rent. But this is Kuta and it is a touristic place so nothing surprising. Otherwise lots of food, drinks, surfing lessons, ans so much more for good prices but do not forget to bargain.

If u don't mind sharing it with lots of other tourists (mostly other Aussie, ha ha) and the locals hassling u to buy things? Then it's a great way to wind down after day of shopping, activities or sight seeing.

This is a centrally located beach in Bali. The waves are beautiful to watch and sunset experience is good too. However the best part of this beach is surfing. We hired some folks for a 1.5 hour long beginner session right on the beach for 100,000 IDRs. The experience was good and different however I am not sure what to compare it with. We did get hurt a couple of times (may be due to lack of skill on organizers part).
Beach is perfect for surfing especially because this activity is not available in Nusa Dua or Seminyak beaches.

We found this beach was full of people selling you things so you never got to relax. The beach has a lot of rubbish on (a common theme in Bali unfortunately) however the worst thing was seeing two local men walking up the beach blatantly filming girls in their bikinis. DISGUSTING. I warned some girls on the beach as the men had sat on the tables and chairs and filmed them whilst posing for fake photographs in front of them. The girls quickly moved and the men laughed at me & filmed me so I gave them a middle finger. Try and head to the uluwatu area for some really nice Bali beaches

Whilst the beach sellers are friendly they are most definitely sales people. We love buying local products but made the big mistake of purchasing over the odds which led to us spending a good two hours speaking with every seller on the beach and spending lists of money. The beach grape vine definitely was ripe on the beach that day, to the point the guys selling drinks told my husband not to buy anymore. How embarrassing for us ! Saying this the day was fun, expensive, but fun and we did not stop laughing with the ladies on the beach, so I’d say worth every penny. We couldn’t afford to go back the next day for fear of a queue but that was our fault for being a little naive. Barter is definitely not our strong point on holiday :)

I am amazed at how crowded this end of the beach has become over the years and as expected the rubbish has also increased. The plastic chairs extend all the way down to the bottom of the market now and are filled each afternoon with drinkers settling in waiting for the sunset. Still a must see.

To look at Kuta Beach from, say, the esplanade at Discovery Mall on Kartika Plaza, is to see a long sandy beach where thousands of people are enjoying themselves in what seems to be an amazing setting. But if you set foot there at, say, Legian, the reality is a little less impressive. I'm not criticising the hundreds of locals who offer services (drinks and food, surfboards for hire, masks and snorkels, etc.). They need the beach to attract lots of people to make a living. But there is a major problem with waste disposal (I picked up plastic straws every few metres) and, to cap it off, the beach isn't really sandy. Or, rather, it's a beach that at the water mark is actually composed of fine shells that are hard on bare feet. I'm sure the surfing is fun but I bet there plenty of beaches in Bali that are more aesthetically pleasing and less crowded.

I have visited Bali from Perth, Western Australia on a number of occasions and have explored the Kuta Beach with long walks, surfing and sunbaking. It has always been ideal as twice now I have stayed at the Hotel just across the road.
It seems to have changed over the years and the last time I learned how to surf. On the Kuta Beach beach in the past, I saw people enjoying parasailing, banana boat trips or swimming. Women offer traditional Indonesian massage on the beach, others are seen getting their hair plaiting.

I meet up with people from all over the world and it was great fun as you can purchase bottles of beer and relax under the shade as well.

The opportunity also arose when I met a Balinese University Student who offered me a carving but instead got talking and in the end was invited to visit his village which turned out an experience of a lifetime as we were introduced to his family and their dwellings where we stayed overnight.

So you never know what you can organise on the Kuta Beach.

We also found it safe as they had Life Guards and lots of warning signs.

Kuta beach has huge waves and is a surfers paradise ! It's visited by a lot of tourists but is well maintained and not dirty.

J.P. KARR WASN’T THINKING BEACHES WHEN PENNING HIS FAMOUS EPIGRAM….

….nevertheless his observation could be applied to KUTA BEACH, which has changed significantly over the years and yet remains what it always was.
So what has it always been? Simply a great place to spend time. The sunsets, the often good surf, the roving hawkers, the people watching are all as good as ever. Some maybe better.
How has it changed? When I saw it first in maybe 1975 it was a lovely white strip of silica backed by palms and padi fields complete with water buffalo. There was only a handful of people on the beach, mostly hiippy travelers. I remember the girls didn’t believe in wearing swimsuits – as a matter of fact they didn’t believe in wearing anything. The good old days.
These days the sand isn’t so white and the beach is backed by an insanely busy beach road with a whole bunch of accommodation places and retailing where the rice fields were. On nice days, particularly towards sunset, the beach is now quite crowded - a huge assortment of visitors (no more hippies I’m sorry to say). We have international jet-setters relaxing on the sun-lounges, young travelers many of whom are pretty keen to join one of the LEARN TO SURF classes (although in recent years way fewer backpacker-types young travelers than the days they replaced the hippies), surfers (a lot now are locals and very good) when the beach break is working which tends to be 50%+ of the time, families sitting on the plastic chairs provided by the beer sellers under the shade of trees back of the sand often being tended to by roving hawkers who can provide just about anything (food, massage, hair braiding, pedicure, clothing, Bali-artifacts at bargain prices but be prepared to haggle), and in recent years a big group of visitors from JAVA and other Indonesian locations, many of whom have never seen the sea. 2018 saw fewer CHINES package groups who have also been plentiful later years – recent Agung eruptions and Java bombings seem to have dissuaded them which is a pity - this is a colourful group in their nice holiday gear.

TIPS – want a best friend for life? Buy an ice cold beer (budget priced) off one of the hundreds of beer sellers back of beach. You get the plastic chair, an umbrella for shade if there is no tree and maybe even some music from a boom-box if wanted. Watch aircraft landing maybe 3km south. My favourite KUTA spot approaching sunset.
- most beer guys also rent out sun-lounge-umbrellas, surf-craft and surf lessons.
- like exercise? The beach continues north for many km – all the way to the surfing/trendoid mecca of CANGGU. I have walked it several times and also riden a rental bicyle at low tide.
- beach orientation means it picks up more ocean swell than most. Surf can be tricky for neophytes. Always swim between the flags (probably 3 sets along 1500m KUTA alone, more as you move north into LEGIAN and SEMINYAK) and obey warnings of life-guards.
- a WET SEASON beach visit even on a nice day (of which there are quite a few) can be disappointing. Onshore prevailing winds can mess the surf up badly and dump a huge amount of detritus on the sand. Storm water drains can make beach walking tricky and the water quite dirty.

This places has become worse and worse as time has gone by. It is not dirty, polluted, crowded and full of annoying pushy hawkers trying to sell you all manner of knock off products. Also look out for that sate stores selling dog meat marketed as chicken.

This place is now far removed from the famous Kuta beach of 30 years ago.

When in Bali in February 2018, there was very little beach left as storms had washed away vast amounts of sand and had left a drop off of at least a metre down to the waters edge, not that you would have wanted to get down there as it was littered with masses of driftwood and other vegetation together with masses of plastic bottles and bags. There was just enough room at the back of the beach amongst the trees for some of the traders to set up their stands. The wind was so strong that it was hard to keep your balance while you were getting sand blasted.
In late May 2018, there was still a bit of a drop off down to the waters edge but the beach was wider and relatively clean and the traders were out with their umbrellas and daybeds once more.
No doubt when we next visit, it will be different again but I doubt it will ever again be the big wide open expanse of sand as it was when first visited in 1980.
Always good to go and check it out though and stay awhile or move on.

You have to beware of thieves and scammers, you just have to answer the rejection and ignore them and enjoy the best times, I think the most beautiful time to visit is at sunset

Yes, you hear a lot of bad reviews, but this July our kids had a ball.
Yes, there was black sand in their swimmers, but they didn't mind.
The life guarded area was utilised by many swimmers, with a lot of kids swimming with their parents enjoying the shade under the trees on the beach.

You definitely have to pick your time of year to get in, but July 2018 was a good time.

The vendors can be a little annoying, but hey, they have to earn a living.

The bars are great. We always go to Jimmy's.

Kuta Beach is a great spot for everyone. The kids played on the sand and in the waves. The adults sat in the shade of the trees and watched, enjoying a cold drink and a neck and shoulder massage! Some of the ladies even did some shopping whilst sitting in their chairs - a few cheap handbags! The kids then had an ice-cream. All of this was offered to us without a great deal of pressure and we were left alone if we declined.

We visited Kuta in July 2018 and one evening watched the sunset (along with hundreds of other tourists)!! Whilst it was a beautiful occasion, the constant hassling by the numerous beach traders became very annoying. Be prepared to be approached the entire time you are there! Nice views but way to crowded..... but I guess that’s just Kuta.

We came here 3 times and did not enjoy it at all. The beach was nice but there were too many sellers one coming by every 5 mins and if you say no thank you they still insist now that's when 2 more of them come and try to sell you something. You're sitting there with 3 people standing around you which was really uncomfortable. We had booked to stay at kuta bali 3 days but only stayed 1 and left to travel elsewhere. we were both really dissapointed cause the beach was really nice

We went out to Kuta beach on our first day in Kuta, we decided to walk from our hotel to catch the sunset. We missed the sunset by a few minutes. The beach was beautiful and vibey. Lots of tourists just sitting on a crate sipping ice cold beers. There are some plastic chairs that you can rent. The atmosphere was pleasant one, with everyone sitting in their little circles with locals enjoying the moment.

We have been at Kuta beach a couple of times during the last 10 years. Last time was in December 2016 and then the beach was more or less covered in debris and also some garbage. Now it was really clean and we saw people, also tourists picking plastic and other garbage. There was even aggangements where people was invited to let free baby turtles and follow them safely into the ocean. In the evening even more people came to see the sunset. A very nice experience.

By all means, visit the beach but be warned - they’re waiting! Who? The hawkers who want to sell you Bintang, massages, t-shirts, necklaces, bracelets, anything.
Best option is to head down to the water and walk along the beach. If you walk up to the chairs to sit, they’ll pounce - just be ready. You can say “no thank you”.

It it worth the hassle? Definitely! The sunsets are absolutely stunning! Sit, enjoy a beer, enjoy the vibe.

Kuta beach being one of the most famous tourist places of Bali, we went there to see the sunset. However, we were very disappointed as the beach was very crowded, unclean and quite average.

We enjoyed the private beach at our Hotel in Kuta better than this place.Sunset at Dreamland beach is the best. Even Sunset with kecak at Ulluwatu and Ullun danu beratan are far more better.

However the shopping street outside the beach is very nice for buying clothes and souvenirs.

Even one can enjoy Cycling by the road of Kuta beach.

It was a evening and we took a walk to the beach . A very crowded place but you can have fun . Lot of water sports activities available . There are a
Lot of shopping that you can do and street food available . An evening can be spent easily here with water sports . Check for high tides before you venture in he water sports . look for safety aids with your agent before go into the waters .

Great evening and great place funsoi

This beach is no where near compared to beaches in California or Miami or Cuba or Cancun.

It's full of locals trying to sell you something, noisy tourists, trash all around, and noisy traffic and bad air pollution due to so much traffic.

It's not romantic nor exotic.

But sunsets are nice. (530pm-630pm)

Do visit, but nothing to write home about.

Once upon a time, I choose my holiday in Kuta Beach. I think this is the good choose for me. Be cause over there I enjoy the beautiful sunset of Kuta Beach with the big wave I saw there and also I like surfer, maybe I will try surf on the next time. In this area has a many of shop what I want to buy. And then I try to use a horse over there, the price is worthed or good price.

It was so peaceful on the beach. I was told that there will be a lot of dirt on the beach but it turned out to be a clean beach. There were a lot of people enjoying the beach, some had gone for a swim... there were locals offering surfing lessons (we didn't take them up on their offer so I can't vouch for their expertise). It's a great place to take a beach blanket and lie peacefully collecting some suntan if you are so inclined. The sunsets are spectacular! Definitely worth a visit.

I was so surprised by Kuta and the overwhelming number of shops in a small area, even having highsteet UK stores such as M&S. There are a lot of market style shops as well and it’s quite good for picking up cotton coverups or MC Hammer trousers. There are tons of restaurants mainly sports themed and seemed to be tailored for an Australian market. There are no real bars to speak of other than the pop up bars at sunset by Kuta beach where you can get a beer for 25,000 IDR and watch the sunset. The beach isn’t much of a sunbathing beach but is worth a look and seems to be popular with beginner surfers and bodyboarders. Kuta is very expensive for food and drink with not many street food stalls, and not very idyllic if you’re looking for a chilled beach vibe. Seminyak further along is much more to my taste and caters for more of an evening party crowd. The best part of Kuta is it’s travel connections and that it is so close to the airport. We stayed in a lovely hostel called Pudak sari Unizou. Worth a 1/2 night stay in this area

Let me start by saying I’m used to Destin, Florida beaches. This was a little disappointing. Kinda dirty. Very crowded. Not an ideal beach I’d go to relax, swim all day.

Ofcourse one of the most famous beaches in Bali, worth a visit but over crowded. There are quiter and more serene beaches on the island if you want to relax.

Do not go for this at the beachside, the ladies there pester you, then say you have to buy a beer if you want a chair to sit on while being braided.

If you want life around you at the beach, Kuta is the place to be! If you want peace and tranquility, better head out to other places! You can sit on the beach ( if you want beach chairs with umbrellas, you have to pay between 50000 to 100000 IDR and you can have it for the whole day), and watch airplanes landing at the Bal airport far w away! There are lifeguards posted at regular intervals, so it's pretty safe. Lots of small children including toddlers on the beach. Lot of beachside surf schools offer surfboard rentals and lessons. The cafes provide beer, sodas, fruit juices and different kinds of food. There are higher end restaurants across the road where you can get various cuisines. Plastic waste washes up on the beach regularly, so be prepared!
In the evenings, lots of beachside cafes have live music, which is not too great but it's fun!

I have been to Kuta about 10-15 times in the last 10 years and it gets worse every time i visit. The beach is fithy and full of rubbish. The whole Kuta area is full of scammers and are only friendly and smiling when they are trying there hardest to rip you off, as soon as they realize you are not interested the fake smile dissapears very quickly. Be careful of moneychangers and do not use the airport taxi stand because they are the biggest scammers of all in Bali.

I understand people need to sell their products, but they can't not be so invasive. I am tired of people screaming to me 20 meters away to ask me if I want taxi or I want massage or If I want to buy something from them. The worst is in the beach when you are trying to rest or read or only sleep and every 45 seconds somebody comes to you and screames very loud offering something. It is so annoying.

Hopefully the rest of Bali is nor like this, otherwise I would not come back never in my life.

We visited mainly to watch the sunset, although there were lots of people sunbathing on the beach when we arrived.

The water looked blue and the sand is a red/brown colour, so not as beautiful as other beaches around the island.

You can watch the sunset from the path that runs parallel to the beach or go sit in one of the many bars or restaurants along the beachside.

A fabulous sunset! Worth seeing.

The local authorities should be commended for the efforts they are taking to keep the beach clean - there are conditioning trucks (I think) every morning, and the vendors seem to be taking more care with their own, and some of the lazy tourists, rubbish.

The beach experience has improved dramatically - now they just need to convince traders to leave people alone as they lay on the beach, often asleep!

We were fortunate to find ourselves on this beach exactly at the time that they were releasing 100s of baby turtles back into the ocean! We got to be part of this experience which I believe happens daily at 4pm.

We then stuck around to watch the breathtaking sunset and enjoy some Bintang from the beach bars - cheap and icy cold!

Such fond memories of this day :-)

With mostly surfers in the water and a number of red or red/yellow flags along its length, this beach is "not one ideal" for swimming; but what's very much worth coming here for, in my opinion, are its "extra-wide expanse" (I was really pleasantly surprised to see this beach about "twice the width" of that of the Sanur Beach where I stayed at which is across town from here) & its "straight-line shape" that just makes it possible for this "panoramic view" when looking out to the sea (unlike the Sanur Beach where the view is "somewhat limited" since the beach is kind of "cut into sections").

And yes, another "big reason" you would come to the Kuta area is because it's one of "shopping galore" (really I would suggest to save your "souvenir budget" for this area with "shop-lined streets" where I saw more varieties of souvenirs than at any other part of the island that I got to); there's also Beachwalk Shopping Center (with brand-name stores, cinemas & even a garden-like outdoor area right in the middle) right across the street from this beach, and that's not the only one of such (I was passing by this area one night on the way back from the Uluwatu sunset tour and was just "surprised" by the nightlife with a number of lit-up shopping malls & big crowds which is really a "stark contrast" to the Sanur area which is "completely still" at night!).

I came here with Perama by taking their minivan (for about 35,000 rupiah for one way) from my place near the Sanur Beach (where they picked me up) to their office in Kuta from which it's just about a 10-minute walk west to this beach (like the south end of the Beach); and before setting out for the Beach (or afterward if you're going to come back to the Perama office to take their minivan back), you might also want to take a short walk (just about 5 minutes north) to the 2002 Bali Bombing Memorial where the names of the victims are engraved on a big plate with their national flags placed in front of it.

Clean beach, chairs available to sit on beach area surrounded with trees and lot of shadow all over. Big area for swimming and lifeguards facility.

Me and the kids (aged 3-12) took surfing lessons from one of the groups of surfers hanging round on the beach. Did 2 hours for 700,000 for 1 adult and 3 kids with an instructor each. Great fun and went back a few days later to the same people to do it again. We initially wanted to use a proper surfing school but they were so expensive in comparison. The guys on the beach were great, loved the kids and were great with them. All the kids were standing up on the boards after a couple of tries and were surfing the wave all the way into the beach by the end.

Then went and released the baby turtles and watched the sunset.

Excellent relaxation. The locals entertain the kids and supply drinks, they even go and fetch your food if you want mcDonalds or some nasi. The sunsets are amazing and the bingo bar is within close proximity to the giant turtle, so the kids can go and release a baby turtle where you can see them. Also they give surfing lessons with a cost involved of course. Just a great spot to sit and relax with family and friends.

Pretty disappointed with Kuta Beach for two reasons.

1-The massive piles of rubbish they throw at the back of the beach. Ruins anyone’s perception of me idyllic.

2- The aggressive local who threatened my husband because he was standing too close to his ‘lounger for hire’.

Not my idea of what a beach should be at all. Will not be coming back.

Kuta is like a better version of Goa me in short.
Too commercial, too busy!
Bali has far better, cleaner, relaxing beaches.
Took more time getting past the omnipresent traffic than we ended up spending in the beach.
You could drop by if you're staying somewhere close by, but unless you're not looking to party, Kuta Beach could easily be striked off from your itinerary..

It is located near the airport and near our hotel. A go-to beach when you want to surf or just chill and relax. The sunset was amazing. The only problem are the persistent vendors who will sell or try to have you rent a mat to put your things even if you already said no. But I guess, they are just trying to make a living.

This beach was located near the airport (Ngurah Rai). You can go there by taking a taxi or gojek or grab car. This beach has a beautiful sunset because this beach was located at the west side of Bali. Many tourist like to come to this beach. They like to just lying on the sand or play surf. There are many local seller at this beach. They sell food, sunglasses, they also can make a temporary tatto for you. They can also make your hairs braided beautifully.
In front of this beach you can see BeachWalk mall Bali. You just need to walk and you can go to that mall.

It was ok. Not spectacular. The vendors make for an annoying distraction when trying to relax. We eventually left after a couple of hours because we were being hounded to buy stuff every 5 minutes. Also, you have to pay to use the loo....firstly, it was disgusting. The floor was wet (urine or water?) And the smell was horrendous. Also,no toilet paper. When I asked the guy for my money back because I couldn't use the toilet in its current state, he pulled out a roll of toilet paper and tried to placate me into using the toilet. Note he had previously told me that there was no toilet paper left. I don't mind paying to use the loo, but not when they can't even be bothered to use some of the money to keep it clean.

If you like to surf, this is a goto beach in Bali. Lots and lots of surf schools available which will teach you from beginner to the advanced levels. This is a very wavy pool (ofcourse, thats what the surf schools go with) and you really close to so many hotels as well.

Sam’s beach bar on Kuta Beach in front of the Grand Inna Hotel . We have been coming to Bali for over 35 years and have sat at a few bars , thought over the years we were at the right spot but found when the money dries up so does the friendship, Until we found SAMS BAR , on the beach and directly in front of The Grand Inna Hotel . Also a great spot to sit if you are interested in the Turtle Release . SAm is the nicest guy , always happy and honest . Come on down to Sam’s Bar Kuta Beach

This is one of the busiest beaches in Bali but it’s just beautiful!
Swim, sun bake or just listen to the waves!
Enjoy the sunshine, but be warned people will try and sell everything from glasses to paintings.
Food is available, as are toilets for a small charge.
You will also be able to hire a surfboard if you’re keen for a surf.
They have a turtle release most days from the south end of the beach, it’s amazing!
Do yourself a favour and visit Blueys Bar, located at the end of Poppies II; and make sure you stay for a sunset!!!

Kuta is one of the good beaches for beginner surfers with more gentle waves coming in. Lots of surf sch to choose from. Crowded beach which is also quite dirty. The beach is quite short and laced with many vendors pushing for u to take a water sport or rent something from them.
Not a place to chill and spend long hours without being approached by a mobile vendor.
Only visit if u plan to learn surfing and want calmer waves... Otherwise, go somewhere else.

Kuta Beach used to be the greatest beach to me. Sadly over the year it has turned into garbage dump with many touts. Sometimes the current brings in huge quantities of rubbish and you find yourself swimming in trash. It is sad that Indonesia failed to protect its natural wealth. Otherwise it still has great sunsets.

Glad we spent the day at Kuta beach! If you come to Bali island you must check this beach out. Great waves for surfing at all skill levels. You can easily rent and get surf lessons in MANY areas along the shore for around 20 USD. Easy to get shade for around 10 USD! You can rent chairs and an umbrella and Heck for a few extra dollars a bucket of Bintang on ice and sit all day waiting for the sunset! Life is KUTA good...

Kuta beach is long and inviting. Surfers and tourists from all over the world wander back and forth along the wise sandy shore without hassles from local sellers. Restaurants, hotels, bars and surf shacks are abundant but not obtrusive. Some curling surf waves crashing in but quite safe in my opinion. Sunsets here, if you’re lucky to get a day without a haze on the horizon, are spectacular. Recommend staking a claim at a beach surfer bar and having a cold bintang beer as the sun sets. About 6:10 pm at this time of year(early June).

One of the best beaches in the world for amazing sunsets around 6pm nightly. The crowd gathers quickly as the sun is going down. Sadly as you read in the other reviews as well, the beach is getting spoiled with garbage from tourists & the vendors who don't help much either adding to the mess. Clean up your mess just like you would at home people...If you walk down the beach away from Hard Rock Café area & go to Life Guard Station # 3 area they have the cheapest tanning beds/chairs that we found in a week. About $9Cdn from 10am to 5pm. They also have the coldest & cheapest beer & drinks in an ice cooler which could not be beat...Little old lady there was something special too. Lots of fun to talk to her!! Barter on the beach for EVERYTHING as these prices are robbing the tourists with whatever they can get from you. Walk away & magically the price will change....The chairs / beds have an hourly price just before sunset so make sure you know what your paying for or you will pay a high price. Vendors are very pushy & annoying when your not interested in buying anything & seem to be relentless at times...Be patient & be nice but tell them to go away or it won't stop. Loved this place especially watching the tide go out which was a pretty amazing site to see how much water leaves the beach in a short time. Pretty cool watching the surfers too! Help keep the beach clean by doing your part tourists from all over the world. Vendors do your part also, very few of you do sadly.

I never get bore of this place altough I visited this place lots of times. The sunset there is just stunning. You can play water board. The waters and the sands there is something that makes me love it so much. You can also braid (30k for locals) your hair there and you can get a massage (50k for locals) there. You can also shop for Balinese clothes (kids 30k and adults 40k and sarung 40k (for locals)). You also buy lots of local foods there like bakso. And the price is cheap enough. But for the drink (teh botol / mineral water 600ml is 10k).

The major reason I didn’t give this beach a five star is that there was too much garbage piled at certain entrances to the beach. The topography of the beach was great at low tide and slanted at high tide. The sunsets were fantastic! But stay a little longer to get the full affect of colors on the beach. There were a lot of guys trying to sell beverages, lounges and chairs, but you just say no and keep walking. However, some of them are very friendly and like if you stop and talk a spell. Most are always smiling and happy. The waves were phenomenal when I was there, it was a full moon. You really should t have been swimming, as there were red flags, but people were anyway. Kuta Beach is a very nice beach to walk as it is mostly flat.

Kuta Beach is very different to those you imagine in the Southern Pacific, with white sand and coconut trees. Bali is a volcanic island, therefore the sand is much darker. And the beach is not exactly clean... need more efforts from the part of the local Government. Nonetheless there are many gorgeous hotels in Kuta Beach that provides you shining swimming pools and lot of entertainment. So forget the beach and enjoy your resort.

We were here for sunset and amazing view for surfing.
I must say the view was spectacular however the beach was dirty with rubbish from tourist. Cigarette butts and plastic everywhere.
If you wanted to have a seat it was complimentary when you order a drinks but the sun longer was chargeable like $25 per day.
We will be back for the sunset in October

The beach it self is lovely and really beautiful, when you walk on the beach you got cheap restaurants and stuff like that. But be aware that you get every dealer on the beach with you in less than 5 minutes. Doesn't matter if it's for sarongs, mattes for the beach, surf lessons, hair braiding, mani and pedi , henna tattoos , ice cream, drinks, sunglasses or just got asked to take a selfie with someone local, you have to be very strict with a NO and still then they stay for another 5 minutes to change your opinion. That's total ruin my beach day. But the sunset is soooooo stunning

We stupidly saw a sign which promised 10,999 IRP to the AUD in Kuta when the going rate was only 10125 most places at Nusa Dua. He counted out the money and we counted it on the counter. 1,100,000 and he then asked for for 100 IRP. As we fumbled in our wallets, he took 300,000 out of the pile leaving us short. We did not notice until we went to use the money an hour later.
I am not sure why people rave about Kuta. I travel the world and I rate it the worst, most dangerous places I have ever visited.

First trip to iconic Aussie holiday destination Bali ... and WOW the beach at Kuta is a cracker!
Continuous rolling surf ... not big but enough to get your board out.
Friendly happy faces and certainly no rush (unlike the traffic circus just 20 metres away)!
And a passing parade of the United Nations. Interesting cultures and most are happy to converse and have a chat if you want.
Plus, your own person beach barman ... for me, his name is Gede (pronounced G’day) - who has been, daily, serving icy cold Bintangs in the same location (opposite The Kuta Heritage Hotel) since 2012!
So obviously has a legendary Aussie following ... just look for the biggest crowd and the G’Day Bar on the signs on the big esky.
This may be my first time to Kuta ... but will not be the last.
All in all, another tremendous Bali experience!!!

Aussies are used to the beach! But not this type, Accept you are in a different country and you will enjoy the experience. When you go onto Kuta beach, Start from the main entrance at the end, and if you want to sit and relax and just look, You will normally be bombarded with people trying to sell things including a seat. Find the first seller on the beach near the beginning under the trees, He says he is the first seller, Think it may be called Lucky Beach Bal. He sells those wooden fake bow and arrows, BUT he can find you anything you want at a good price! without you even moving. We were looking to buy one of those stunning large Kites that you can some-time's see in Bali. Most of the shops did not have what we wanted so we went to look on the beach and met this chap who is in the picture with his thumbs up. Buy him a beer, he will pull up few chairs and it all comes to you, he was great to talk to, his English is very good, He supports his family by selling on the beach every day, he will run off and bring back what you want at a good price. So my recommendation, Find him buy him a beer (funny that his mate next door sells COLD beer and coolers! Sit down and enjoy the sights and have a drink or two and Let him arrange the shopping for the things you may need, still bargain a bit with him but a great way to spend an hour or two and the spring rolls are delightful, No guts ache later either!! He got us three great Kites and an afternoon of cheap entertainment!! Cheers.

This review will be short and sweet. It’s a beautiful beach but just overcrowded. If you walk along it it seems you can’t go more than a couple of metres without being hassled to buy this or get a massage.

Reading some of these reviews is hard to think we're talking of the same beach. My visit consisted of constant haggling, one woman tried 3 times to do my hair & after the last no, was just simply rude.
The amount of garbage was just disgusting. My son tripped over a whole bbq duck still on the metal rod it was cooked on.
Maybe you need to walk another few kms down the beach to get a nicer position. Won't be coming here again. Would reevaluate if you have young children.

Me and my girlfriend had a great time here. You can seat and enjoy the sunset, while sitting on a chair with a little plastic table and drinking a beer. Dont go to the part where the hotels are based, since that is extremely turistic and you will pay more. Stay in the beginning part of the beach which is still good. All locals and old turists comment on how this part of the beach remind them of "the old days", before the boom in turism and decaying of the place over the years (nowadays is dirty).

I visited this beach in early May with a friend of mine. The beach itself is not bad (albeit there are much nicer beaches there), but the experience itself is poor. As we walked down the beach you will be harassed by someone either trying to sell you a beer, surfing lessons, trinkets, a massage, ice cream, a shawl or flip flops. You're just never left alone and while I do understand that some people have to earn a living, they should also understand that I will eventually run out of patience to say "no, thank you". The beach has some shaded areas due to the trees planted down the side, but almost all these locals and their beer carts have taken the shaded space thereby leaving no shaded area for public visitors. This is probably to encourage you to sit down on their plastic chairs with an umbrella and buy their drinks. Overall, my advice is don't bother as I have been to MUCH nicer pristine beaches on the island.

If you’re in Bali, its good to spend a day in kuta beach sun bathing and get a cold bintang and in the afternoon the sunset is absolutely gorgeous, and lots of nearby restaurants. pretty good place to relax and enjoy the sunshine and sunset view.

A lovely beach with incredible sunsets. Well worth a walk in the evening to enjoy the area.

The sea can be a little rough, great if you're happy in the sea or want to surf. We spent quite a while playing in the waves and finding areas where inexplicably the sea bed was feet deeper than next to it - resulting in someone being in water to their knees and someone standing a couple of meters away (same distance from shore) and being shoulder depth. Good fun!

If I`m being honest I`m not a beach person, I really don`t like sand and I don`t want to be hounded while I try to lounge around and get some sun.
But if you go at the perfect time and catch the sunset, WOW its magnificent. Take a seat and grab yourself a Bintang and enjoy the view.

Every beach around the world has something unique about it. With that said, Kuta Beach is good for surfing.

It is not a good beach for swimming. It is too rough and the water is like a dirty brown soup. I literally saw 3 dirty diapers and a mirad of plastic litter within 50 yards on the beach.

But one thing that is good is that it is a short walk to Finns Beach club. They have a nice pool and view of the beach.

Kuta beach has always been a very popular tourist attraction for many decades, but today, it is even more crowded than my last visit 15 years ago. If you want to visit a nice beach, go to Seminyak or Nusa Dua.

Just home from our fifth stay at Kuta. We always love to spend a couple of hours every morning just sitting on a chair with our feet up on the beach in Kuta (for the cost of one small bottle of soft drink) watching the surfers getting dumped on the large breakers as they roll in. You will be pestered by the locals selling their wares but if you are not interested just be firm and say "no thanks" and it is only a small price to pay for an enjoyable relaxing time.

You can take a lot of surfing photos in daytime and romantic shots during sunset. Yes, there are a lot if tourists but I think it is not very crowded (based on my oberservation near Sheraton area in May 2018). The vendors won't keep asking you when you say no politely, which is better than the famous beaches in other countries...

Long and gorgeous beautiful beach. The only negative is that when the tides out there’s lots of trash which is covered up when the tides in. So it’s in the water when you’re swimming. You don’t notice it much out there but a little bit. Lots of people, tables and vendors up on the land but everybody was very mellow and not bugging you all the time. Great place to learn to surf.

Kuta beach is mainly for surfing. U can cool of in the shallow waters, but can't snorkel as the water is very murky. The a number of beach goers soaking up the sun, as well as pesky vendors selling "massage". It gets rather windy in Kuta, so u'd find plenty of kites in the sky

First time when I came I was shocked how dirty is the beach. But there is little you can do about it, the most important that this is one of the best places to learn how to surf. Lots of surf board rental, easy to negotiate the price for the board and the lessons if you need instructor. If you come in rainy season you will be completly dissapointed, however in March beach looked complitely different than in January and it was a quiet clean.
Recomend it for surfing. Do not recomend for swimming.

Kuta is quiet nice beach though. I went there to see the sunset, and it was great. People can also do surfing during the daytime. If you want to learn how to surfe, it costs you arround Rp 350.000 - Rp 500.000/1.5 hours.You should becareful to the people who force you for buying useless stuff. Just keep saying "NO", then they will ignore you.

A lovely spot, lots of access to amenities in and outside of the hotel. They take good care of the hotel and good care of the people that stay here. Front desk is manned 24-7.

Awesome Beach..... the sand and the surf.... super.
At the beaches in Kuta and the surrounding areas, I understand that the beach chairs and umbrellas etc are rented out by the locals.... and you may need to bargain with them. But otherwise they are friendly, helpful and simple people.
The beach is excellent and safe. We had a lovely time there. Best time would be before 10am and after 5.30pm..... otherwise the sun and the heat could kill you.

The first visit here for me was nearly 40 years ago... and some practices still remain, pineapple sold by vendors, drinks,”you buy my sarong’. The Balinese people amazingly, have retained their good honour and friendliness. They have strong cultural practices whihc many could learn from. Many tourists are rude and disrespectful. They come because of the culture but dont respect it when they are here

Coming here on the last day, I was randomly choose this place for watching sunset.
Sitting by the beach, drinking a bottle of Bintang, listening to live music by the local band while sunset. Isn't it awesome?

So many people come here, for the beach, for the surfing spot and for the sunset.
One plus about this place is that when the sky got dark, there is a sky full of stars around you and it's amazing to watch.

Don't miss this when you are in Bali!

Iconic beach but I have been VERY disappointed with the enormous amounts of rubbish that regularly accumulate on the beach and in the sea. I have voiced my disapproval to the Bali Tourist Authority at the airport during four visits in the past three years and encourage other visitors/tourists to do the same to "save" the beach. Ironically, from my observations it is predominantly the Hindu locals that do most of the littering during the observance of sunset. Sadly, locals in general need to be better educated about littering and it`s affects on tourism. When clean Kuta is a fascinating place and the people are ultra friendly.

Beautiful sunsets and cold Bintangs. Beach bars strewn all along the wonderful stretch of Kuta beach. Beach was very clean at the end of April 2018. Lots of local vendors/hawkers selling almost everything from massages to spring rolls. Hawkers can be a tad pushy but not aggressive. It is all part of the Kuta experience so just go with it. Got a wonderful massage from Mama Wayana (No 32) for only 100k . Locals are incredibly friendly and very chatty and are quick with smiles if you engage them. Kuta beach is a great place to meet international travellers and take in the hustle and bustle of Kuta beach. Highly recommended but go with an open mind and open heart to enjoy a unique part of Bali and South East Asia. Ps. Please support the local vendors and remember haggling is part of process and can be incredibly enjoyable. Kuta beach, give it a try for a once in a lifetime experience.

Kuta beach was lovely but it was very busy with harassing locals wanting you to buy items off them. They were constantly coming up to you. We sat under a parasol and had a beer from one of the guys.

Kuta is a happening place in bali so is the Kuta beach. Its a 3km long stretch beach with a suttle and amazing wave which is perfect for surfing. There a lot of vendors that rent out surf board and provide training rite at the beach.

We've stayed in Kuta location in nice hotel, but unfortunately we need to say we did not like Kuta beach at all. Beach is full of dealers who disturb you all the time so you can't really relax in there. On the top of this beach is really dirty, rubbish is everywhere in water included. So if you want relax on the nice beach and don't meet rubbish in the water when you go the sea, I recommend to go to different beach

Just watched the sun set over the ocean at Kuta Beach, what a beautiful experience.

If you are in Bali then this is one of the most special places to watch the sun go down.

Just a word of advice though, if you are going to go there by taxi from Seminyak expect it to take over one hour as the traffic is horrendous at that time of the day.

Very crowded beach, the authority should definitely make an effort to keep it clean and tidy, i feel this beach has been hyped a lot, since there much more beautiful beaches in bali , can be due to the luxury hotels and bars in this locations ,

We were only here a short time. The reviews about the beach being dirty and having pushy sellers were accurate. Still, we felt safe and found the atmosphere to be lively. Cash is king here as per usual and be prepared to haggle.

Guide books and reviews suggest this is Bali’s most popular and best beach. I’m not sure if I agree, as I personally prefer Seminyak. However, that’s not to say that it isn’t lovely here.
Be prepared to be approached by locals selling sunglasses, caps and sarongs whilst you relax. We paid 50,000 IDR (£2.50) for a sun bed and parasol for the day which I thought was good value - although some traders will inevitably try and charge more.

Overall it’s a clean beach but the waves can be quite high so not ideal for swimming.

Go there to check it out. Have a drink at one of the many beach bars. We liked Sam’s Bar. Sam and his crew are friendly and of course the beer is cold and cheap.
Then go to somewhere like Legian further up the beach for the same thing but cleaner with better surf and a sandier beach.
Seriously, Kuta is just not that nice a place.

Walked from the South part of the beach (airport) to downtown Kuta (Hard Rock cafe) and the south part of the beach was completely strewn with garbage - heaped up in some places = evidence of potential clean up?

Things got a little better north of Discovery mall, but I wouldn't venture in the water. In the downtown area the surfers were literally dodging garbage in the water.

It's a real shame. There were signs apologizing about the (seasonal) nature of the garbage, but it was a real downer. So much so, that after a couple of walks we never went back, preferring to take a cab over to Sanur or Nusa Dua.

We started out mapping the things that we wanted to do, but Kuta to Ubud is no short trip. So we walked to Kuta Beach and met the best driver in Bali. Barros our driver, is not one of these drivers that can only drive you for a few hours or 6 hours, Barros dedicates the full day to you. He never complained. We went from Kuta Beach to Ubud. Stopped at the painting and weaving spot, hit the markets, took a daring swing on the Bali Swing, had tea and coffee, then on to Titur Empul (Holy Water Temple) and then to the waterfall. We even stopped off and had dinner. Barros was happy to serve us. He does airport transportation as well. Very friendly family man. I recommend, if you have a small group. Look no further. Book him in advance and tell him that I sent you.

More hawkers than tourists who almost make you feel like running away from the beach. The ambiance is overall dirty and there is trash all around.

Not sure if we timed this really badly but kuta beach was awful!! It was extremely busy and we were constantly harassed by vendors who have covered it in cheap plastic chairs to try and get you to sit down and buy drinks etc. Traveling with my teenage daughters they also received a lot of ‘comments’. However if you walk up towards Seminyak it is much, much nicer and quieter- with a lot less washed up plastic!! Shame because we quite liked the rest of Kuta/legain.

Lovely beach very crowded but who doesn't love the beach. Everyday around 4pm the gather everyone round to release a baby turtle which is an amazing experience and it's free. Amazing for pictures and helping the kuta community who runs this. Perfect for tanning and close to shops and restraunts.

Kuta Beach, being near the city attraction this is the beach where tourist usually heads up to. So expect a crowd when going especially in the late afternoon to evening. There is a mall you can passby to go to the beach.
The warm sea water and with waves that can go from gentle to rough, offers a beautiful view of the sunset. Some do surf the waters, i even saw some folks doing some fishing (and when i asked them, they said there are no fish... so, i don't know why).

The constant harassment by people trying to sell their goods (jewelry, massages, tattoos, clothes, hats, sunglasses, etc) spoilt the memory of surfing with friends for the first time.
The waves are ideal to learn to surf.
If you want to learn to surf, go to Kuta beach.
If you want to barter and buy goods, go to Kuta.
If you want to have a relaxing time in the beach in between catching a wave, DON’T go to Kuta beach.
This was definitely one of the big disappointments of our Bali trip

This is our 3rd vacation to Bali and have never ventured to Kuta before until yesterday. Fellow travellers we have met have advised it isn’t a nice place to go - so on this occasion we thought we’d see for ourselves.

This place has an entirely different vibe to anywhere else we have visited on the island and not one I care for. It seems to be the “party haven” with sports bars and even a beer cycle vehicle which we saw a couple of times, the occupants getting more and more inebriated each time it passed by and this was in the space of only 2 hours!

A great deal of traffic runs through, with scooters and riders who have no courtesy to pedestrians zooming out from narrow alleyways I was nearly clipped a few times by s scooter.

Vendors on the street are quite aggressive with their tone and body language standing in your way and pointing with arm out stretched in an ordering type of way to go into their shops. Hey I need no persuasion but a few manners wouldn’t go amiss. Many are selling cheap tat you wouldn’t want to buy anyway.

It’s the assumption all Brits are cockneys and they would chant unamusing comments at you and some insulting if you failed to look in their shop. I heard one vendor following a tall man calling him John then followed this up with John Wayne-Ker a take on trying to get away with insulting the gentleman.

We were offered viagra from a man stood on a street corner, cheap cigarettes, all done discreetly however - incredibly distasteful behaviour. You’re also badgered every few yards with local people passing you a card “free” another irritating interference with my holiday - must be timeshare.

Really horrible aggressive vibe here, dearer than Ubud or Jimbaran.

The beach has a surf and the ocean a beautiful colour - very busy and this is low season.

Would I recommend here - not in the slightest. There was nothing about Kuta that made me feel I was in Bali and I wanted to catch the next bus out back to Jimbaran.

This place is not for swimming or walking. Tones of nature and human’s garbage on the sand - unpleasant to see it, unpleasant to be there. Unfortunately this beach is a good viewpoint for sunset watching.

Best surfing with this crew. Best bar to sit and relax and enjoy a drink or a natter with the staff. Wonderful family to spend time with. You can even have a sing along. Great place to watch the sunset at. Drinks are also cold.

I have been to a lot of beaches and this one is probably the worst one ever. We were so disappointed in how trashed the shoreline is with plastic. There was really no place to sit in the sand and it felt unsafe to take our sandals off. I could forgive a littered beach but what I couldn't overlook was all of the plastic in the water. It literally felt like we were swimming in garbage. I've never witnessed anything like it. It was so depressing and I really hope that some of these huge investors in Bali address the plastics problem. Fortunately we came to Bali to experience the culture. If you are going for the beach go somewhere else... or at least get a hotel with a great pool. This beach deserves 1 star but I gave it 2 because the locals there will give you surf lessons for dirt cheap.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,55,50>===============  
Very long beach with tides that change very quickly. When the tide was rising around 1:00 pm, surfers appeared to catch the waves. Not a Beach that you can really swim as the surfer break line is close to the shoreline. Certainly not a Beach for small children. Lots off vendors and food offered along the shoreline. Did notice a wee bit of garbage on the beach like straws, wrappers, etc but nothing stinky or smelly. Great place to sit and watch the waves or hop in them.

Love coming to this Beach but lately its lost its Fizz i will still come here again but they need to change it a little bit maybe have a band on every night like they do in the Pubs and Clubs all it is like a drinking Beach maybe have food stalls set up as well im sure its not too hard to do

Kuta Beach wasn’t that great, it wasn’t that dirty but it wasn’t clean either, but there were too many people trying to sell me things the entire time, if the local people can stop hassling tourist all the time, the experience might have been better.

Every 10 steps I took there was always someone hassling me to buy they service or products.

Seriously it was kind of annoying , hope the situation gets better there.

-Not Cheap at all- besides the $10 massages

Don’t recommend at all

Came here before many years ago. This time around I brought the whole family. The environment is still the same with the many make shift seats people selling drinks, massaging, mani n pedicure. The sad thing is the condition of the beach itself. It’s not like before. A lot of rubbish on the beach. Even though I saw that they are cleaning up the beach! If you want a better beach experience go some where else in Bali.

I would have given Kuta Beach a higher rating had it not been for all the rubbish littering the beach. It is a shame that a potentially beautiful beach is ruined by neglect.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,56,30>===============  
It’s a beach that is good for surfing. Lots of places to learn to surf, waves are not too large and water is shallow so it’s really good for beginners. I took a 1 hr surf lessons for 150,000 IDR.

It’s not a good beach to relax and swim. There is a lot of trash around, the waves can get too rough for leisure swimming and there are so many surfers that it seems dangerous to just float around. Also when. Sitting on the beach, vendors aggressively harass you to buy their wares.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,56,10>===============  
It is quite depressing to see how polluted our oceans have become, but if you want to know then Kuta beach is a great place for that!

Unfathomable amounts of plastic are washed ashore and lay strewn across the entire beach, before the larger objects are vaguely swept into piles by locals and left. The smaller pieces are absolutely everywhere in the sand that I could see after walking up the beach for an hour.

It's a consequence of what we do as a world, which has spoilt a place that was once probably beautiful.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,56,20>===============  
I was so saddened at this beach, it has been completely ruined by people, pollution, plastic and litter. I guess this is the consequence of mass tourism on Bali. Could not swim in the water without being swamped by litter. The sand was also covered with litter. Made me feel really sad that humans are doing this to what should be a beautiful spot to visit

I will never return to Kuta beach, it is completely trashed. The sand is filthy, i spotted used needles along with all the plastic. I went surfing for a few hours and wherever I went in the water there was plastic brushing off me. Truly an awful experience, not to mention being accosted to buy things by countless people whenever I sat on the sand.

Don’t waste your time here. Go somewhere nicer, quieter, and (most importantly of all) cleaner.

Coming to Bali, dreamed about paradise-like beaches, laying under the shadow of palms on the seashore, and drinking cocktails in the small cozy cafes. The reality has broken our dreams into small peaces.
The beach is awful - the water is full of rubbish and muddy, a lot of rubbish is just laying on the send, the send itself is neither yellow nor white but close to be grey. There are no cafes all around - instead of them there is only a long black severe wall coming across whole see shore. So being on the beach you most likely will feel like at the graveyard not in the paradise.
In the evening there is a lot of locals selling drugs spinning around both sides of this wall. Certainly, it is often used as a public toilet. So don't expect you will enjoy a beautiful sunset - all that happens around will definitely spoil your mood

Kuta Beach has many good points about it, it has an amazing break for surfers, it has very little/small rips most of the time and there is a a large amount of stalls and shops you can go to. It is ruined with the amount of population on the beach though, there are rubbish collection points on the beach, if you have time I would suggest grabbing a bag from them and giving them a hand
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,57,30>===============  
Visited here with the hope of getting some swimming, but his primarily a surfers beach with lots of schools teaching surfing. The waves were of a good size and although difficult to swim in you can body surf.
The biggest drawback to the beach is the amount of rubbish and particularly plastic, both which you continually bump into in the water and on the beach. At different points on the beach there had been attempts to clear up some of this into large piles, but the large piles had not been removed.
There are numerous small drinks vendors with an umbrella and plastic chairs every 10 yards along the beach! You will also have lots of beach vendors trying to sell you goods or trips, but a polite no seemed to do the trick.

I was looking forward to see Kuta Beach again after twenty years as I remembered this fantastic beach with surfers and big waves.
The waves were still there but this time plastic was floating around in the sea and spread all over the beach.
So sad to see all that garbage and I think this is becoming a threat not only to the Balinese tourist industry but also for the ocean and all it’s inhabitants.

Yes, it is still pretty to see the waves and feel the sand and ocean breeze on your feet. However, you can't do it without the locals' making you buy their products or service.
Not planning to come back.

Heaps and heaps of garbage on the beach and in the water. Tons of locals trying to sell you beer, blowguns, head massages, ear cleanings, toe clippings. They will NOT leave you alone, instead hovering behind you and constantly harassing you. Do NOT go here, just drive up to Canggu.

Kuta Beach was only 5 min from our hotel. We walked there on our first day in Kuta to check out the beach. We were disgusted with the amount of trash piled along the beach. I can imagine how beautiful it was if there was no trash. We walked along the beach to the mall. We never went back again since there are cleaner and more picturesque beaches in Bali.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,58,20>===============  
We spent a couple of days on the beach learning to surf and playing beach volleyball. The expansive beach should be a beautiful haven for relaxation, kite surfing, massages, beach soccer, swimming and surfing. However, it was very sad to see the immense amount of litter both in the water and washed up on the beach (plastic bottles & straws, styrofoam, blue cleaning cloths). We also saw two dead fish rotting away and covered with flies.
Many people on the beach will try to sell you surf lessons, kites, day trips, bracelets, and even drugs. They are pretty respectful if you say no thank you and keep walking. Beware that in order to use the toilets and showers there are fees. They usually range between 20 cents and $2 CAD, which may leave you in a bind if you are not prepared for it. Most restaurants and bars on the beach strip usually do have washrooms you can use but not usually showers unless you are staying at the beach hotels and know where the showers are located. We once washed our feet at a beach hotel because it was right outside and we were on our way to a restaurant where you couldn’t walk in with sandy feet. There are a total of 3 volleyball courts: 2 are side by side (near Citidiens restaurant and hotel) and are reserved for 2s (one court is competitive and one is recreational); the locals, many of whom are very friendly and welcoming will let you join in on the fun. We only had one incident with a couple of belligerent and rude male volleyball players who we assume are an aberration and not the norm in Bali. The only downside to these courts is that there are often many players waiting to play and you may only get to play once or twice in a couple of hours. We brought our own ball but found no one at the courts during the day to play and too many people between 4-6:30. The third court which is in Legian beach was filled with locals playing 6v6. They were also very friendly and welcoming, however, we were only able to sneak in one game per evening before the courts were too dark to see the ball.
If you walk near the beach walk area tonnes of taxis and motorbikes at the entrance of the beach will constantly ask you if you need transportation but if you walk along the beach, you will be constantly asked to buy something or Rent surfing equipment.
I have never been stopped so many times on holidays and asked to have my picture taken with strangers; they were mainly school kids who probably haven’t seen dark, curly haired women with a tan very often and I didnt mind at all but I can imagine some people might. They always politely asked with a hint of shyness and embarasssment and I was always happy to oblige.
Many little bars consisting of coolers with ice and seating areas (plastic chairs, lounge chairs, bean bags, big umbrellas) peppered the beach if you are looking to have a refreshing drink and enjoy the magnificent sunsets...which are gorgeous!
The beach has the potential to be amazing but due to litter and constant attempts to sell various items from vendors I cannot give it a good rating.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,58,40>===============  
During the day the beach is ok - a few stray dogs which is super cute, lots of people trying to sell you things (sarongs etc, but even a guy with bow and arrows!), and the sand/water isn't the cleanest -cigarette butts and plastic dotted about here and there. but the sunset was simply stunning! possibly one of the best I've seen in my life - i'd definitely recommend here if you love a good sunset.

The beach was really upsetting, over the last two weeks we have been swimming here, the shore line is covered in plastics, bags and bottles and the ocean is also full of rubbish.

I don't think anything changes at Kuta except the people who work there, tourists who visit, and the people who just chill out there. Everything else remains the same. On my most recent visit, it seems to have become dirtier, with rubbish being washed in with the tide and just left on the beach. So that is a big minus. I would love to go for a swim at Kuta Beach, but with the rubbish all around, something tells me this is not a good idea. Also, the strong currents seem better for surfers than for people like me who are not strong swimmers. Still, it is a nice beach to sit and relax and drink Bintang to your heart's content, until the magic sunset makes its appearance. On my most recent visit the reward was the most magnificent sunset I have ever seen at Kuta, and it was well worth the wait. Otherwise, Kuta is a good place for people-watching and for photographing. Be prepared to get hassled my massage ladies and sellers offering all types of wares. Kuta Beach is one of the "must see" places of Bali, but not a place to get addicted to.

Kuta Beach is just 5-10 minutes walk from our hotel. It's a great place to learn how to surf, waves are just right for beginners.

Second time in Kuta. Came back for the surf. Just before coming I read so many bad reviews about the state of the beach, being full of plastic trash. In my current experience I can say the beach was cleaner than I expected it to be, so maybe the officials are cleaning it up faster now? However, the water is soiled with floating plastic debris ranging from candy wrappers to plastic bags to sticks, etc. I still enjoyed my surfing, but I was rather disappointed by the state of the water. What habe we come to that our seas are filled up with so much trash?

Every beach has its ups and it’s downs. This beach in particular I had high expectations for as it is in one of the most popular parts of Bali with regards to Tourists.
It is covered in litter, the beach as well as the sea and it is also jam packed with tourists. The only really good thing is that there are lots of surfing opportunities here.
Sadly on one of the days I did come here there was a washed up turtle the same size as chair.
There are plenty of restaurants and bars on the beach and nearby, and there are people who walk along selling ice cream and cold drinks.
There are other beautiful beaches in Bali and this beach could be one of them if there wasn’t so much litter.

Since our hotel located near the kuta beach, we decided to take a stroll over there and what amazed me was the perfect pink sunset that happens during the dawn. The atmosphere was twilight and it's a tourist attraction over there as o saw majority of the people there were tourists. If you walk 20 mins more you could see the shopping centre called Beachwalk Kuta for more hipster brands items such as Pull and Bear, H&M, The Body Shop and many more.

I don't even understand how people can call this a nice beach. I've been to many beaches and this is by far one of the worst ones. There is trash everywhere on the beach. There are loads of aggressive and rude vendors (some even wake you up to try to sell you something) selling anything/everything - and it is constant! You can hardly relax here. We rented a pair of beds under an umbrella for the afternoon (200k) since we didn't want to lie down on rubbish. We didn't even stay until sunset because we got fed up. Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere. This has given us such a bad impression of Bali.

The sunset was nice but it appears that all the garbage & debris from other parts of the world end up Kuta Beach. Heaps of natural debris but also all sorts of plastic garbage. We did not spend much time there, instead went to the pool. I would wear shoes too, the one empty syringe I saw concerned me. You can get food & beer on the beach so can just sit there & enjoy the sunset. Also it is close to the airport.

Please be wary of the ladies offering manicures and selling their products. Can be very insistent and even annoying if one has a short fuse.

Nice to visit though and noticed quite a few surfers
Great avenue leading to it from the side I got access where there are many things on sale

They say Bali's beaches are the best in world right? I was so sad when i came to this beach in February 2018 you can barely see the sand for the rubbish its disgusting and as humans we should be ashamed! you cant even walk down the beach in peace without been hassled to do water sports either. would definitely not return.

This must be one of the most sad, shameful places on earth. Lined alongside all of the billion dollar hotel chains sits the filthy polluted Kuta beach.
Why anyone would want to visit this sad place is beyond me!
The hotels whose location means that they profit every day from this place should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves! How difficult would it be to club together and clean up the beach? Surely in return they could stop reviews like this being written?
It leaves you feeling sad and frustrated visiting this place and should be avoided at all costs. Staying in one of these hotels is environmentally irresponsible !
Why surround yourself with plastic, garbage, dog mess and general pollution? It left me feeling extremely concerned for Bali and the lovely Balinese people. I for one will not return unless something is done about this place and will make sure that I tell the truth to people about this sad place!

There was surprisingly a lot of plastic... This is so unfortunate and probably unavoidable since this is happening around the world.

There would be a lot of garbage and plastic in the morning when the tide leaves plus when you are swimming in the ocean you have to swim through the plastic!!

People/workers do clean up the garbage during the day. and the beach is nice by about 2-3pm.

It was really nice as the water cooled our feet down but I wouldn’t swim there (waves are to big it’s more of a surfing beach) and the shore was incredibly dirty. So much littering and trash that every time a wave came in a piece of trash (at least one piece) would catch itself on your leg.

Miles of swimmable brown sandy beach located along Jl. Raya Pantai Kuta (Boulevard) lined with 4 stars hotels and little bars, cafes serve western & local foods, desserts, beers and fresh coconut juice. Night clubs along Legian Street. Unfortunately some remnants of trashes were not totally picked up at Kuta Beach locations.
I suggest go to Amed Beach for scuba diving & Snorkling along the shallow water reefs full of colorful clownfish and sunken ship.
For challenging surfing go to cleaner sandy beaches along Seminyak and Canggu, Bali south of sacred isles Pura Tanah Lot.

This beach is a joke. A joke thats not funny.
Its a local dumping ground for washed up rubbish coming down from the north; littered with beach bars and plastic chairs.

Its such a sad disappointment to have the opportunity to visit this beautiful place only to wade through rubbish and annoying vendors.

May I suggest Poppy Land one -small Mexican Restaurant with Air Con and cold beer instead!

The water is really warm. But the beach is dirty, debris floating in the sea and on the beach. Sadly, every few metres you'll be harassed to buy an ice cream, go for a surf lesson, have a massage or rent a chair. Overlooking this, which could make the beach experience miserable, the locals are friendly and the view after a storm is amazing. Once you leave the beach, you'll be harassed once more for a massage, rent a motorcycle or taxi. Or book a trip to something somewhere. I confess I lost my cool after the umpteenth person approached me and was rather rude and abrupt. His response was, "Thank you for your smile!" This caught me off guard and I DID smile, he wished me a nice day and moseyed off to annoy someone else. I felt awful. For two seconds.

I give it 2 out of 5, one for the sunset (amazing) and one for the surf. The amount of trash on the beach is the worst I have seen in Asia. Fully expected the council to clean the beach every day like in thailand, but thats not going to help because the water is full of plastic bags, spoons you name it. Since I was last there 20 years ago the have put up concrete wall all the way along the beach road with accessss points to the beach, what a terrible idea, now you can't see the beach from the road. The sand is brown BUT, not all doom and gloom, the sunset at around 6.45 pm is amazing, get a chair and a beer and enjoy it.

I love Kuta beach, especially the area near the Art markets. The little beach bars are great fun to sit at in the shade of a tree with a cold Bintang watching the ever changing parade of entertainment.
The hawkers and massage ladies with their quaint banter, the great food from the little warungs and ladies on the beach just makes a great way too spend a few hours. It's Bali to me. It's great safe fun for a single couple or family.

The water is an extreme health risk. Visitors should not swim in Bali's waters. I've been coming to Bali for 20 years and the water is now thick with pollution.

I was in bali from 8th Feb to 18th Feb 2018. Sunset at Kuta beach is amazing. However the beach is filled with plastic dirt everywhere.. The water is so dirty, I couldn't dare to get inside it as everytime I was walking in the water, some plastic bags stuck on my foot.. It was very disgusting experience. Some good tourists were cleaning the beach. Also so many Balinese locals keep disturbing (a single no is not accepted) by insisting to take a massage or by selling stuffs. The beautiful beach needs some cleanliness to offer what it is capable of..

We could not relax as the woman selling brackets and nails and massage would not take no for an answer!!

I wish there was less garbage but it still can't beat the perfect sunseton the Indian ocean. Start from kuta beach at half past five and then walk to legian and seminyak beaches to experience the sunset while walking(legian is less dirty). Swimming is impossible because of the waves, and also far dirty to swim here.
And don't forget to check the more secluded beaches while you're in Bali. Don't make this the only beach in your visit.

Kuta Beach is filled with tiny pieces of plastic in the sand and in the water. It's not just lying around. It is simply all over the place and impossible to avoid.

Walked along the beach every morning for the two weeks we were there. Lots of rubbish on the beach due to rain and people not putting rubbish in bins.

Beach is amazing but a couple things really put me off it. The main thing being all the rubbish on the beach, it is heavily littered. The litter problem is huge in Bali and while this is no fault of the beach, it does detract from the attraction. For most of the beach it's also a bit annoying to deal with people constantly bugging you to have a seat, buy a cold drink, take surf lessons or start touching you for whatever reason offering massage/weed/whatever other drug. If you want a nice relaxing beach, go to Gilli Trawangan or Lombok.

I was heartbroken and so disappointed to see the amount of garbage that is constantly on this beach. at one time it would have been a beautiful place - nice sand and an epic view, but you are overwhelmed with the amount of plastic bottles and refuse that covers the beach. it seems to wash up with high tide, and every morning you are greeted with an unending thick line of junk and garbage along the high water mark. Tragically, there seems to be little to no effort to clean it up. Once in the 12 days I was there was the beach raked, by hand, but the garbage was just raked into huge mounds higher up along the beach. Over a long section of beach, there would sometimes be two or three people sifting manually through these piles, slowly pulling out wood pieces, or empty plastic bottles, but very little progress was made and the piles were never removed, just added to. My hope to spend holiday time on the beach was just not possible. This country seriously needs to fix their garbage problem - it's basically almost everywhere, and ruins the experience completely.

Nice big beach, bit sometimes, mostly in the raining season, lot of plastic from the ocean on the beaches, but this is not Kuta's fault, this is the civilisation. Anyhow, even sometimes they are cleaning the beaches, but the government should improve and engage the beach hotels to pay for the cleaning.
Puplic toilets are existing, but since years no maintenance or renovation, so in a very bad condition.
Many places where you can buy drinks, but occupied by Coca-Cola, it's a bad thing. But good and cheap local food is beeing offered, better than in the most restaurants.
Again palms are growing, many years before they cut all trees to enable parasailing, no parasailing anymore and the trees gone.
Good place for surfing. Coming again

This once beautiful pristine happy Beach area is now a slimy red light dive .
you cannot walk more than two meters without getting perpetually hassled by Beach vendors trying to sell you a seat or a drink .
the beach itself is littered with rubbish and the water is dirty once you cross the road to the shops this was once a bargain area shopping district .brazenly call themselves things like" the genuine fake shop "where they sell the worst quality pirate brands .they try to rip you off and as soon as you offer them half that price within an instant they will say okay. even then they are all just $2 rubbish items from China.
the men will sleazy eye on your women.
however at night the place comes alive in true red light fashion heaps of prostitutes drug Sellers and booze.t
thousands of younger people who go there to get rotten drunk enjoy the bar music drugs and alcohol and do not seem to notice that they are being ripped off blind for this privilege I will never ever go back there again.there are other beaches... and a shopping suburb called krishna where you buy local stuff at local prices just a grw kilometres away.

It’s a beach. It’s Kuta. It’s filthy.

Sit down on a chair and have a “Bloody Cold Beer”. Enjoy the sunset and get harassed constantly to buy junk or to get a bad massage.

There’s far better beaches to visit. I suggest you try one of those.

Honestly was shockingly disappointed. I had never been haggled more to buy something or rent a surfboard. More so than Europe or streets of cities in SE Asia. Beach is not that nice, so much trash, and not even that great of surf. If you want a true Bali experience there are so many better more secluded areas on the island.

Personally I love the hustle and bustle of Kuta beach I equally love escaping it to my hotel for peace and quiet when needed. It has so much flavour in food style and people that keeps us coming back. Disappointed this trip with the rubbish washing in on beach certainly hasnt made it appealing to go in the ocean this time on Kuta beach. But they're doing their best to clean it all up. Not busy at all all locals saying no tourists very quiet the volcano scared people off. Come I say...

We stayed at the Bali Garden Hotel on Kuta beach, but just prior to our arrival, the area was hit with a cyclone and it was taking the authorities quite some time to clear all the debris from the beach.This didn't stop all the visitors and locals gathering on the beach at sunset to watch. We wouldn't swim in it. By the time we left 10 days later it was much better.

Spoke with a woman in our hotel who says that the plastic only washes up around the "windy" or "rainy" season. Don't know if it's true or not, but it's disgusting. The locals try to improve the situation by raking up the plastic into giant piles, but it looks like it is a constant job. And then, you still have these mounds of garbage. People sunbathe next to the mounds as if they are not there. The hawkers weren't as bad as one might think, but maybe it is because I never stayed in one place for very long. Lots of surfing and swimming, but I can't imagine what they run across while in the water.

The amount of pollution along this stretch of beach is so upsetting. I guess being Australian we are so spoilt with our beaches here, that seeing the philth along the sand and in the water at Kuta is heartbreaking. That aside tho the Balinese selling their wares and offering Bintangs along the beach are still a welcoming site. Just make sure you keep your valuables out of sight.

Well I had high hopes about this beach, but when we visited this place on the first evening itself I was disappointed to say the least. First of all there is not much you can do on this beach except maybe walk.

When we visited it was extremely windy and cloudy, so no proper sunset either. Also I could see a lot of rubbish littered around the beach.

This was the worst beach I've ever been to and I've travelled a lot in my life! The garbage and plastics was literary all over the beach and in the water. It was basically impossible to sunbath on the beach and swim in the ocean without stuck in some kind of garbage. And the sellers there are all over you like mosquito in the djungle. I have only one word to say: HORRIBLE! The government should really do something about it!

We have visited Bali many times over the past 20 years and have travelled all over the beautiful island and enjoyed the culture, scenery and people. Sadly over the past recent years, we have noticed such an increase of rubbish littered on the beach and land all along the tourist strips of Legian, Kuta and Sanur. The large hotels get their staff to clean directly in front of the hotel and thats it. With millions of tourist dollars coming into Bali every year, it’s a shame nothing seems to be done about the rubbish problem. Some of the locals say the government do not provide a rubbish collection. Where are all those tourist dollars going ??
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,71,10>===============  
It’s. Dirty, lots of garbage washed up on shore. Annoying ‘touts’ who’s harass you to teach you surfing. Up and down the beach. Really tiresome, waste of time. For the amount of tourists that go down there local government could have a clean up crew through the day and crack down on and restrict the activities of the touts.

The beach stretches several kilometers, is easy to reach and offers many services (renting beach beds, boards, drinks, food, massage). Though, there are many service providers, and this might be annoying. Shape your bargain skills!
Good for surfing lessons. Warm water, stable white waves most of time. Sunsets could be very beautiful there, and many people often gather to enjoy them.
In high season and good weather, the beach could be very crowded. Pollution is also a problem, although local guys try to keep it clean.

Cleaner than expected. A lot of rubbish, but mostly wood and not too much plastic. They cleaned it as good as they could and tractors were collecting rubbish. A lot of small warungs. Surfer lessons. Not to many people swimming. High waves and windy. A lot of sellers. Would not recommend Kuta beach in January. Go to Sanur, lovely beach, even in rainy season!

- KUTA Beach is considered one of the most famous beach in bali. It is just a minutes away from Ngurah Rai airport.
- We had our stay in front of kuta beach. And everyday waking up in hotel in front beach was memerizing.
- Beacuse it was infront of my hotel So we visit here daily.
- It's long sandy beach and great waves for surfing and lots of bars, nightclubs, and hotels around.
- Kuta Beach is often a site of events, including festivals, surf contests, and concerts by local bands.
- Mcdonald’s, Pizza Hut, Starbucks and many more are at walking distance.

Each afternoon in Kuta we go to Simpson's Bar to watch the amazing sunsets. It is almost in front of the Bali Sea Turtle Rescue Centre, in front of the Grand Inna hotel. Beers are $2.50 and Smirnoff's are $3.00. Simpson and Robby are the friendliest people on the beach, (we have tried others), and they set up plastic garden furniture where you want it to watch the ocean and the sunset. Authorities do use tractors daily to collect the rubbish coming from Java, but this year there was a lot. Simpson and Robby keep their area clean by regularly raking up the rubbish. These guys are so nice, helpful, funny and friendly!

This beach is very busy, especially in the early evening before sunset, with loads of locals, tourists and touts. We suggest finding a drink stand and select your favorite beverage while the proprietor gets your deck chair oriented towards the oncoming sunset. Sit back, relax and stick your feet in the sand while you enjoy your cool drink and experience an amazing Bali sunset.

You’ll almost certainly be approached by numerous tours offering everything from massages to clothing to tourist trinkets but if you’re not bothered by this you’ll have a wonderful sunset.

I know it’s not Bali’s fault, but this beach at this time of year is terrible.

I remember a few years ago in April it was beautiful, we loved watching the planes fly in, and watching the sunset, but during this season, it’s just gross and full of rubbish.

We did fly our kite on the beach and chat to the helpful locals who corrected our kite flying technique, but I didn’t want my kids touching the sand, and I didn’t want to stay long.

It’s a pity because it is so lovely other times of the year.
I still enjoy the locals and walk along the path. But stay away from the sand if you want to stay clean. Don’t go in the water.

Anyone who says Kuta beach is nice must never have travelled anywhere else!
The beach is absolutely filthy with rubbish all over the place and washing up along the water's edge. The number of huge chunks of wood getting washed up are extremely dangerous for swimmers and surfers, I'll bet the local hospital is full of people crazy enough to enter the water.
We tried sitting on the beach and that was a horrible experience I never wish to repeat. As soon as you sit down and stare at the trash riddled sand, hoards of hawkers descend upon you like a flock of seagulls on hot chips trying to sell you all manner of crap no better that the rubbish lying on the floor. Don't both telling them to go away, they won't listen and continue thrusting junk in your face bizarrely thinking you'd want to buy it. The only solution would be to feed the pests and give them your money, but like giving chips to the flying rat seagulls that would only attract more. The only sensible solution is get up, leave and never come back!

Kuta Beach is huge with a pretty deep beacharea... far from waterline to back of the beach. The heat and the not so clean beach result in few sunbathers so the beach looks a bit desolate. Mostly surfers.

I always come here whenever I visit Bali because this beach is like the default beach you should go to whenever you go to this island of the gods. It's easily spotted because of the crowds and is located in the famous Kuta area. The beach spans for at least some kilometers from the back of Discovery Shopping Mall all the way to Legian area.

The beach is perfect to enjoy the sunset because it faces to the west. The sky usually turns to pastel pink and blue with a tint of orange and white clouds during that time. There is a lot of activity going on from surfing, sunbathing, just casually walking around, swimming, etc. Overall a crowded beach especially during afternoon.

I usually just came here to watch the sunset and then spent the rest of the evening walking around the Kuta area and to the shopping malls.

Stayed in Kuta 3 years ago. That time we were a bit shocked to see much rubbish on the beach every morning. Every morning locals were cleaning the beach, but next morning everything was the same. This time everything is as it was that time. Rubbish in the morning and people who clean the beach. The rest of the day it's ok. When you get into the water, you can feel much plastic bags surrounding you. The point is that Asia is the biggest "supplier" of all that stuff into the oceans and seas. Need time for them to undestand, that littering is bad and better find a trashbin.

Walked the whole length of this very busy beach. Very disappointed by the level of cleanliness and upkeep. I would have thought that the hotels that benefit from the beach would have done more to keep it free from all the plastic and detritus that is washed up on it.

Surfing is the only activity which happens there ( i guess due to close proximity of airport no other activities are allowed ) and its fun. The surfing lessons can be taken for as low as 150000 to 200000 to IdR which includes surfboard and instructor and lasts for 2 hours.

There are so many places to stay in Bali - depends on your budget, interest and group activities.

Kuta is a place for water activities, night life with live bands, club, bars and during the day time, you can travel to other parts of Bali. A wide variety of hotels from b&b to 5stars hotel and the shopping mall is also available with variety of International brands.

I enjoy live bands and have many things to do even in the late nights unlike other parts of Bali. But, you have to travel and spend more travel times to visit other parts of Beautiful Bali - Ubud, Uluwatu, Kintamani, Novia etc. depends on traffic, it varies for the travel time but I am sure you are not getting bored to stay in Bali during nights. But, you expect to see mix of local people and foreigners in Kuta while more foreigners can be seen in Semiyark.

Tips- don’t stay in the same hotel for long days and try to change from one location to other. And this would give you a different experience in Bali - for om busy town (Kuta, Semiyark) to quite town( Uluwatu or Ubud)

Kuta is the busiest beach in the island. There are street (beach) vendors everywhere and the hassle can be intense. We got a nice spot to lounge, swim at the pool and keep away from vendors right on the beach at Headquarters bar and lounge, it made for a great relaxing time at this nice beach.

This location is truly the heart of Bali. All the action is here. Quite a few restaurants along the golden mile like Macdonald’s, Pizza Hut, Starbucks and many more. Great for youngsters and partying.

The beach however isn’t too good at all, really dirty !! No water sports on offer besides surfing lessons. If you want a nice clean beach it would be better to go for the day to Nusa Dua.

I expected an awesome beach holiday and all I got was a dose of reality. The amount of pollution on the beach and in the ocean is unfathomable for anyone for Cape Town. Coming from a city that is extremely litter conscious to a beach where every wave wrapped my ankles in plastic and rubbish was a huge eye opener for me in terms of how bad water pollution is in a global context. I was told it is the monsoon season that brings in the dirt. There are efforts to clean up the beach but it still a sight for sore eyes. I chose to swim in the hotel pool instead. On the plus side, there are some great cafes. Also, everyone wants to braid your hair lol!

I have to be honest - I was shocked and horrified by the amount of rubbish that I seen on Kuta and Seminyak’s beaches. Apparently it comes from another part of Indonesia- Jakarta and rivers. All the people in Kuta and Seminyak began a clear up programme, however their was tons - literally tons of rubbish washed up on Bali’s beaches - Bali needs to investigate why this rubbish is coming on their shores from Jakarta as the plastic is killing the marine life and birds. Bali is s beautiful island and beautiful people but they have to deal with why this rubbish is coming to their island. It is still Bali’s problem as the rubbish is coming from Indonesia and of course Bali’s in Indonesia- so saying the rubbish is coming from elsewhere is not the answer. Incredibly shocking

Kuta beach was clean and nice to swim. Hawkers that try to sell things are quite a nuisance. You can rent an umbrella and chairs on the beach. The sea is great, but there are some strong currents. Parental supervision a must in my opinion. The beach is long and perfect for strolls. Not too busy.

Unfortunately the rubbish being swept in by the tide makes this a dirty beach . Out first morning and the plastic bottles washed up were horrendous...but they have got cleaners now but still the bottles are floating in the sea.

Kuta beach is definitely not my cup of tea.

We spent the first 5 days of our holiday in Kuta . It was just way too busy for our taste.

There was a nice Mall in Kuta called Beach Walk, which was quite good .

The streets were dirty and there were lots of people offering drugs and woman.

I wouldn’t stay at Kuta Beach if I was traveling with kids.

Next time we go to Bali I would prefer to stay somewhere else, like Seminyak.

Good for sunset walk and drinks. From a distance looks like a good wide beach and has a boardwalk with hotels, shops, etc. The boats lined on the beach looked romantic. But once we walked closer to the shore, it was terribly dirty and lined with trash. Also the mosquitoes were vicious in early December after the rains. Overall disappointing since we had heard a lot about it. However, it was easy to get to good restaurants and the Discovery mall where there was a live show of Balinese dancers right outside the Starbucks.

The water was brown and you couldn't swim for five seconds without being covered in plastic. The beach itself was covered in rubbish with a sole excavator moving more and more of it into a corner.

I’m well aware of the problem of ocean trash and plastic but during this trip it really hit me. We visited Kuta beach the first time after 72 h continuous tropical raining.

This is the busiest beach in bali from my experience. But in a way that is nice. You get anything in this beach. Easy access. Only for the car parking you have to pay. You will fine lots of restaurants around or any finger bites beer water is available at the beach itself. And they are cheap. You can do surfing or have a quick massage for cheap.

Different people have different choices.
If you like the roar of the sea then you can go to Kuta beach in Bali. It’s the most popular beach in Bali.
You can take the chair hot the day or for the hours. You can surf here, the instructor will teach you first then go to the sea for surfing.
Moreover it’s a clean and safe beach.
You can also play beach volleyball if you are in group, if not in group, then you join in a group. People becomes so friendly when they are close to nature.
Enjoy,,, it

Bali is one of my favourite destinations and we always feel safe there .

We love to stay in Kuta for its location and everything is accessible easily.

We came across a scammer during our last visit, first time of this kind for Us in Bali and wish to share here which might help you all .

It was around 10 PM , myself and wife decided for a short walk after our dinner .
Suddenly a car came in front of Us and try to park at the side of the road .

We look at the driver for his rush act and he then open the glass window and asking if we know any Indian restaurant near by .

I tried to help and told him about Queens Tandoor. He seems having a fix set of questions ready for me and keeping me busy asking 1 after other without really listening to my answers.

Finally he told me he is from Dubai and on the way from airport and he asked me the forex rate of dollar and INR .

I told him are you referring to AED , he quickly said yes and showed his wallet and at the same time asking me if I have Indian money , he wanted to see INR .

I found it’s fishy and replied I don’t have as I don’t live in India and quickly move away from there .

When I try to review the entire situation which might lasted not more than 1.5 minute , I realised he was expecting I will take out my wallet and he probably want to snatch it and drive away .

Surprisingly there were a lady and another man inside . Once we left , they took u-turn and went towards the Queens restaurant as I told the location but did not stop there .

Thought of sharing this .

We all know we should not talk to strangers but it might worth not to offer any kind of help to strangers as well to avoid unnecessary hassles .

Not a spectacular beach but if you want to learn to surf in reasonably small waves and nice soft sand then this would be a good location. The beach is long and crowd density varies with wave height.

I'm not sure what had happened at Bali while we were visiting but nearly all the beaches were plastic and rubbish as far as the eyes could see.

I heard that they pump their rubbish out to sea. Not sure if that's true but it would account for the amount of rubbish strewn from Tuban Kuta and Seminyak. Kuta Beach was exceptionally bad. Tractors worked for days and still rubbish everywhere covering the shore when we left. It wasn't really an ideal beach to sit and enjoy the beach, let alone swim.

Whatever went wrong the government need to address this level of pollution. It was nearly as filthy as Echo Beach, Canggu which was disgraceful.

We just loved it & you can see the Balinese are really making an effort with tourists. Lots of fun & laughs to be had . My partner had a surfing lesson & had so much fun.

We are staying in a hotel just across from this beach and the views are amazing, however, as you walk up to the beach you can see disgusting amounts of rubbish everywhere. More so I was walking on the “sand” and got a large piece of glass stuck in my foot. There are also many merchants who will harass you to buy their products which isn’t nice when you’re trying to relax at the beach. Not worth coming here as there are many more beautiful and cleaner beaches around Bali.

Pretty filthy Beach with lots of garbage around. We visited the beach for some fun in water but were extremely disappointed with the upkeep or rather the lack of it.

We returned yesterday from our first trip to Bali. We had never been to Indonesia before, and I honestly loved everything about the island… except the filthy Kuta beach. I absolutely cannot believe how many reviews say that the beach is beautiful- it is utterly filthy! It is physically impossible to swim in the water without being touched by pieces of floating trash, and that is no exaggeration.

There are giant mounds of garbage on the beach (see attached photos), which the tide seems to reclaim each day. I don’t know why they pile it up but never remove it. We were there for four days and I never saw a clean beach.

Everything else about Indonesia was amazing. We loved the food, the people, the scenery… Everything was great except the beach.

One of our waiters told us that the locals are actually responsible for the majority of the pollution. He said that a lot of poor/uneducated villagers in the areas nearby still dump their trash into the ocean. He said that the ocean currents drag the trash back to shore on the west side of the island. He said that beaches on the east side of the island are usually cleaner than the west side.

I would happily go back to Bali for anything else, but not Kuta beach.

It also seems like it would be hard to relax on the beach due to the number of people constantly trying to sell you stuff. It doesn’t matter how many times you say no, they are persistent and try to make you buy something. I actually had to raise my voice to a couple of people and tell them to leave us alone after politely refusing them numerous times.

Nice beach. Only a few steps from our hotel, Grand Inna Kuta. Sand is fine but not very white. In the morning til around 8pm there are chairs which you can borrow if you order food and drinks. Bintang beer costs IDR25K while food costs around IDR35K. Massage is also being offered at IDR150K.

The most popular beach in Bali is really fantastic when it's clean. The sand is soft and white and you can walk along the water's edge searching for corals and interesting shells. With swimming one should remain within the swimming areas as marked by the flags. Swimming outside is dangerous because Kuta does have very string rip currents that move in a southerly direction dragging you quickly down the beach. The advice given is not to try to swim against the current but to use it and gradually head in towards the beach.

Further out to sea is the Kuta Reef which is a reef break for surfers and can be reached by taking one of the many boats found in the south part of Kuta Beach. The cost varies and you'll need to bargain the price down, but the boats will take you out either for a ride for an hour or so or drop you off to surf and wait for you. A word of warning, only surf on the reef if you are at least an intermediate level surfer.

There is something about just sitting on the beach, cold beer in your hand and watching the waves roll in that seems to take away all the day to day problems. Kuta beach itself it fantastic, not the greatest beach in the world, or the cleanest but the guys that look after the small bars can’t do enough for you and for us is a highlight of our holiday.
Having said that the beach sellers have totally spoiled this and although I know they need to make a living they have become out of control. On our first visit to the beach we were literally set upon by about 2 dozen vendors and to be honest although we are used to this we felt extremely intimidated and some of the other couples that hadn’t experienced this before were actually quite confronted by them. I don'y know how you control it but the guy's who have the bars need to address it or they will loose customers I know that lost us.

Every day we stay at Bali we go to Kuta beach at around 3pm to catchup with the locals now if you don,t like sellers trying to make a living you are going to the wrong place for a holiday.
We always talk to the locals and if you do you will get a better experience and after a few days they find fresh meat and flock to them.be firm with them but in a nice way.
We have a friend who works a bar on the beach and some days he might sell two drinks but he is always smiling would you be.!!!
Depending on the tides you will see some rubbish on the beach but every day they are cleaning it they aren,t throwing the crap in the water we are( tourists).

We arrived at Kuta beach expecting the paradise we had seen advertised online, and were incredibly disappointed to in fact find a beach covered in litter. There is litter in the sea and all along the shore meaning that if you want to swim, you must first wade through yoghurt pots and plastic bags. The beach seemed popular with surfers however we chose not to stay as even sitting on the sand, we would have been surrounded by rubbish.

The sunset in this place is really amazing, but since it is one of most famous beach in Bali, so the place is crowded. It is also a bit dirty, there are some people who throw garbage everywhere.

If you want some quite time to enjoyed the beach, just come in the morning, you can't clearly see sunrise in this beach, but i quite enjoyed my visit in the morning. since there are not a lot of people. You can enjoyed the beach as it is your own private beach. You also can see some Bali's People do their prayer in the morning.

When we are in Bali, no matter what have been doing during the day - we always end it on the beach having a Bintang watching the sunset. It is just magic and there is something different every day.

I visited this beach in October 2017. It is clean and long (not very long) beach with clean waters and shore. There are many options to spend time here and to enjoy the beach. It is generally safe for swimming (except few areas, look for the flags). There are beach chairs/beds available for a cost and there are several food and beverages options. One can also visit a beautiful temple at the entry road of the beach and there is market too. Other beaches like Legiyan and Seminyak are not very far from here. There are hundreds of restaurant, shops and entertainment options on Legiyan Road. In the night, this area is famous for its happening nightlife as there are several bars, discos etc.

The beach is so dirty, cans, plastic bottles and bags all around. I didn't have courage to get in the water, it was nasty. You can't stay here 5 minutes in peace, someone will try to sell you something, if you find a spot, of course. Don't expect a cristal clear turquoise water as you've seen in pictures. I don't recommend at all. Go to other beaches instead.

Kuta Beach is a great beach for surfing. The waves here roll in all day and are also close to shore so no major paddling out required. They are plenty of beach bars that you can chill out and either watch the surfing or just chill out

I'm so sorry but some reviews were overrated. I thought it was nature that I will experience but just saw plastic, trash, bottles, detergent containers and all types of plastic and trash at the beach. Couldn't bear the people swimming with all the rubbish at the beach and the water. No one was being responsible and cleaning the are. I was dissapointed
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,90,10>===============  
Having heard so much about Bali we were looking forward to a paradise style beach, however that bubble burst as soon as we set foot on the beach, the amount of rubbish on the beach and in the sea is staggering, something needs doing urgently it comes to something when holidaymakers are spending their time trying to clean it, perhaps if the army of hawkers cleaned a small part of it each rather than continually badgering you to buy something because the way it is going they will have no one to sell to!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,90,30>===============  
As it is a famous beach in bali, I thought it may be nice. But as an indonesian myself, it is just a very common beach like we can find anywhere in indonesia. The only special thing is you can see alot of people surf there.

I think Kuta Beach is a little average and is a beach that has grown out of tourism and not a Balinese experience, I avoid this place and instead head up the east or west coast for better beaches with no trinkets or simply over to Nusa Dua for some great beaches as well.
Happy Travels!

This beach could be such a lovely beach and I’m sad to be giving it a rating of 1 but it has been completely ruined. There is rubbish everywhere, they do try to clean it up but I suppose there is too much of it in the sea already to help much.

Kuta beach is a must visit if you're in Bali, it has stunning views and the fencing surrounding it is beautiful, if you're looking for a quiet place to chill out I wouldn't recommend it since it's very crowded and there are lots of people that will try to sell you anything that you can imagine, in order to avoid having trouble with the vendors I would recommend you to politely reply to them: Tidak Makasih, on the other hand If you're trying to buy something rom them, always bargain since they will try to sell you everything for a very expensive price. It has surf lessons and a lot of beach activities, if you're lucky you might be able to watch the locals perform ceremonies such as Melastih. All in all I highly recommend it!

This is a lovely beach which we noticed is very well maintained from all the rubbish that arrives on the shore each day.
The first mistake I made going to Kuta beach was accepting the offer of massages for my wife and I and hair braiding for our 3 year old daughter.We had just arrived off the plane and were not up with the bartering so paid high end spa prices for some old homeless looking women to take care of our wary bodies.For the next 30 minutes while being massaged the same beach sellers kept trying to sell us their junk.A polite no is not enough with the same sellers coming back 4 or 5 times each within the 30 minutes to annoy us.My wife never wants to step foot on this beach again.On the plus side my massage by a 90 year old homeless lady was surprisingly good.

Probably one of the dirtiest beaches I’ve ever swam in. You’ll be surrounded by plastic bags swimming. The water is clear so its disappointing to see it not well maintained and ruined by people this way.

Its has decent waves suitable for beginner surfers though. So if you’re planning to learn surfing its a pretty nice place to go to. If you’re planning to swim you’re better off going to another beach. Bali is full of decent beaches with nice and clean sands.

All we wanted to do was sit on the beach and watch our children splash in the waves and watch the sunset but the seller are really annoying and would not leave us alone.

We went for an early morning walk down the beach & was very surprised to see so much activity going on- it’s fascinating to watch. Plenty of joggers, people walking dogs, groups doing yoga & martial arts. The beach itself looks nice & clean. There were some pretty big waves so I’m guessing this would be ideal for surfers!

As the title says.....surfers’ paradise. There was no space in the water for people who just want to swim. We were able to paddle in the shallows a bit but not for long. The surfers out on the boards we’re having a blast though....was fun watching them for a bit.

It’s the excellent sunset beach in Bali. Must come. Recommended both for small and large peoples. You can drink beer or eat something here, near the beach.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,93,50>===============  
Whatever you do, if you are visiting for the first time, don’t stop walking. Be careful. Check prices for plastic chairs and umbrellas with the vendors. Ladies that walk the beach and offer bracelets and massages- be aware. You shouldn’t pay more than $50,000 for sarong and tops $50,000 for massage and manicure. The older ladies will ask you for $200,000+ , do not let them touch you! They also try and charge you for umbrellas on the beach too, even though they belong to someone else...: my advice would be- get yourself a towel and sit next to the water. Do not bring your blonde child with you either. We had approximately 30 people lined up to take a picture with my two year old daughter. The beach is clean, but the locals didn’t let me enjoy it.

This is my second visit in Bali and Kuta still a must place to go! Arrived on 4.30 pm, walking around the beach, and enjoying sunset while laying in the sand.
Crowded by locals who sell many things but they surely still friendly after we said no to buy.

I spare time to jogging in the morning too, and that was the best. Many people exercise in Kuta Beach until Legian at the morning and bring their dogs too!

The Kuta beach is full of activity. It is one of the main tourist beach so is extremely busy all day every day. You will often get stopped by locals selling anything and everything - this does not stop all day. On a plus side you can learn to surf here! Surf boards are available on rent. There are also numerous hotels and bars along the board walk that are ideal for a spot of lunch/dinner or if you just want to escape the crowds for a little while! I would recommend coming here for the unmissable sunsets purely because there is nothing that puts you into holiday mode more than watching the sun set over the sea!

I love this place. The sound of the waves crashing and fresh air is beautiful. Plenty of bars set up woth chairs so you can sit down and relax. There are alot of beach sellers/massagers that ask of you want to buy/want a massage, if you don't then say no, they go away. We made a friends with a few ladies selling/massaging. Beautiful people. We also found our new favourite place (Lily Bar) at the front of Sheraton hotel. She is amazing. She gave us a bucket of melted ice so we could cool ourselves down, she say down and had a chat. We went there 3 days in a row and she looked after us great. Definitely have a look.

The beach appears to offer a welcome retreat from some shopping or touring within Kuta.

The beach is tidy and offers some nice views and some very appealing areas to sit in the shade at the top of the beach.

You will see drink vendors along the beach who will allow you to use their chairs at no charge and they are very friendly.

Once you take your seat the action will start. As the freshest meat you will be swarmed by locals selling watches, offering temporary tattoos, tours and in my case a 100 year old woman offering massages to both my wife and I. Be aware that there is no such thing as personal space and they will stand there until you are firm enough to say “rack off” (potentially trained in the no means yes sales school ‍♂️)

I try to not be the aforementioned person that is rude to those only trying to make a living but at this location this was the only tactic that worked for us.

Once they move onto the latest victims you will hopefully get at least a 3 minute window of peace to enjoy your beverage and the view in front of you until the next group of locals that was further up the beach arrives and the cycle starts again.

I will not use the chairs if I go back.

The beach is worth a 3.5-4 star but the experience is a 2.5-3 out of 5

It is a really nice sandy beach, if you go here for the sunset you won't be disappointed. Buy a beer and watch the sunset come up, free chairs if you buy a beer and it is really cheap beer. Just ignore the Beach sellers and they won't bother you, get into conversion and you have trouble, they will sit down and want to talk for 10 mins (if your lucky) but will Expect you to buy. Just politely say no Thanks and look away.

We visited Kuta Beach for several days and most enjoyed the sunsets with a cold beer on a beach chair at Elly's Bar. Elly has several chairs and tables with umbrellas on the beach with her name, Elly, on each. She offers cold beer and snacks and a chair to watch the sunset. You will find her spot by entering the beach across the street from the Pizza Hut and just look for red and white chairs. The sunsets are well worth it!

Kuta beach is a large stretch of clean sand. It doesn't seem a popular pass time to sit on the actual beach and the areas under the trees close to the path seem much more bustling. The break can be quite powerful so be careful with smaller children but there is often decent surf and there are places to rent boards along the beach. Each afternoon a turtle sanctuary releases baby turtles into the sea and you can queue up to take part in this which is lovely to see.

Sadly this stretch of beach has been ruined by the many aussy people that sit around drinking throwing empty beers cans and bottles into the ocean thinking it's funny.

Went to Kuta Beach two times for surfing, enjoyable experience however note the following:

* Find a beachside bar and chairs (run by the locals) who will get you a spot in the sun and beer by the crate. Simply drink until you're finished and the owner will count the beers you drank and charge you for all at the end.

* Hire a surfboard/boogie board! Not a must to but makes the experience a bit more fun.

* There will be bargainers, locals will walk up to you often trying to sell you all sorts of market knock off goodies (along with some traditional items), it may get overwhelming at times so don't afraid to be stern if you want to be left alone.

Fun with family, friends or a group!

Kuta Beach is very clean and less crowd, you are not disturbed with too many visitors.. but the beach is having little slope.

Kuta beach is usually a bit crowded and and may have a lot of trash in the water as well as along the beach (it depends on the current and the season, really) But if you are unlucky to stay there at the wrong time and witness the rubish in water it will put you off swiming there! There are a lot of sellers go around ofering souvenirs, drinks, food, massages or surfing lessons, some may find it annyoing. However, its a good spot for beginers to take surfing lessons. Location in terms of accomodation choice, shoping and dining is very convenient. The beach is good for evening promenade and watching sunset. Plenty of restaurants and bars at the first line street after the beach but not as crazy and scatchy as the Sky Garden area. There is Bali Turtle Conservation Center on the Kuta beach, which gives fantastic oportunity to release small turtles to the ocean ( you need to look at the official website for the information or may come around and ask about day&time of next release) Usually, you can find an announcement note by 12am. Come around 4pm to take a token to be able toparticipate at release ceremony starting at 4:30pm.

If you enjoy croudd, traffic and locals hawking you to get hotel promos then this is the place or you. Nothing special here at all typical of a singles pickup area. With many night clubs bars and plenty of eatouts to choose from, wander the streets for hours to snatch a bargin in local markets. Would not recommend you take small children unless you plan on staying resort side all the time. Nothing here you can't get on the east coast of Oz just without the vehicle noise and smell and hussle of walking in hot humidity just to save a buck or two.

i was expecting this beach to be a lot busier and scruffy, yet because its so vast it doesnt feel too busy at all, loads of people to watch, surfing, jogging and just having a good time, yet plenty of space.
there was a bit of debris washed up on the sea edge at some places, but quite few and far between.
nice to sit and watch the sunset or walk from one end to the other.

Amazingly beautiful, charming and the right amount of crowds. Not overwhelming like some of the popular beaches tend to be. We went every day of our stay in main Bali (Seminyak). Easily accessible via Grab from any part. Has some fabulous restaurants and shops nearby.

When I thought of Bali I pictured white sands and clear blue sea. Unfortunately this beach reminded me of ones in the UK. Murky and dark beaches.

The Beach sellers harass you constantly tryingnto sell you glasses when you're wearing them, massages and drinks. This is not unusual to Bali and one of the frustrations of going anywhere where tourists are relied upon for the locals income.

However the sun was out and the waves were great. This beach is perfect for learning to surf and there are plenty of surf schools and individuals willing to teach you to surf.

In summary great for surfing but nothing amazing here.

After our first surf lesson, we decided to practice by renting a surf board. We were apprehensive because there were many reviews stating there are lots of scammers and to be aware. When we arrived at the beach, we saw an advertisement for surf lessons and we looked at the boards and easily negotiated a price of 50,000 IDR for a few hours. There were boxes to put our belongings in and compressiion shirts available to borrow. When we returned the board, they didn't inspect it just put it back in place. There were no issues and we were happy surfing the waves. A clean beach and lots of great waves.

We came here on our last day to enjoy an ocean breath... we were lucky as an international surfing contest was on ! So you can have long romantic walk but better on sunset and be careful of the sea ... especially with kids. It’s a surfing place not a swimming one.
Then you can enjoy lot of nice but expensive restaurant or bars around ...
not our prefered one.

I’ve spent many a day sitting on the beach having a Bintang or 2 from Lucky’s Beach Bar. The locals will have a go selling you their goods but once you’ve purchased or not it’s all relaxation. When the sun sets it’s indescribable, remember to take your camera.

In terms of the beach itself I mean.. this is Bali so anywhere is absolutely stunning! However, this is the main tourist beach so is extremely busy all day every day. Because this is the main beach you will often get stopped by locals selling anything and everything - this does not stop all day. On a plus side you can learn to surf here! There are also numerous hotels and bars along the board walk that are ideal for a spot of lunch/dinner or if you just want to escape the crowds for a little while! I would recommend coming here for the unmissable sunsets purely because there is nothing that puts you into holiday mode more than watching the sun set over the sea!

The beach in Kuta is higher on the sea, and very frequented to people. The beach is not equipped , to gym big bar or other , only many little bar with chear and parasol umbrella.
Everiday for the sunset in the beach many people waiting the sunset, for the Balinese is for praying and tourism or Indonesian people not Hindu for simply see the sunset.But the must beautiful face to Kuta beach is the squirrels , yes in this beach many squirrels living in pace and nobody hurt this beautiful creature.Another famous aspect to this beach is the surfers , and many beach boys from Sumatra everiday spend his time on the beach , work in this little bar teaching surf play soccer. Not a special beach ,but worth a visit

There is nothing better than on a hot afternoon in Kuta to head down to one of the beach bars pull up a chair and have a nice cold bintang. Once you get over the inundation of Balinese wanting to sell you their wares you can get into some serious relaxation, watching and waiting for that sun to set on the horizons. The photos you can take are awesome when the weather is spot on. It was a daily ritual heading down to Kuta beach in the afternoon and I highly recommend it to everyone.

The sunsets in the afternoons are amazing. Grab a Bintang or cocktail, sitback and relax and watch the sun set over the ocean. On the other hand while at high tide it can be quite nice, once the tide drops all the rubbish is exposed. Lots of plastic. Also lots of people selling things, if you're not interested, just don't ask how much, just politely say terima kasih (Thank you) and they'll be on their way.

I have read reviews on kuta beach before leaving UK and was a bit apprehensive of going to the beach due to reviews saying it was dirty and some people had seen needles. We have been several times since arriving and it has been fantastic. The beach is lovely and clean, the sea is great. It is lovely to lay back, relax and watch the surfers. Yes I had a giggle at the people trying surfing for the first time but it was great to watch, I'm not a great surfer myself but not a total novice. Enjoy the beach when you get to kuta but don't forget the sunscreen you don't want to look like a lobster tomorrow

Visited the beach in between shopping. The beach was relatively clean . Too many vendors annoying you . Not a place to chill by the surf . The beach was reasonably busy and the tide was a fair way out . The sand is fairly coarse . I can see how it is attractive for the party set as there are plenty of bars and eateries.

Lovely beach but always jam packed with tourists and vendors. Hawkers may be aggressive but you can always request them to not to approach you politely. For those renting surfboards for surfing, please do remember landmarks and key nodes of where you started surfing. Would be quite difficult to find the correct vendor's stall to return the surfboards after you are done.

How does one review a beach such as Kuta Beach? Are you a surfer? You will totally love it! Are you a stroller or walker or jogger? You will adore it! Are you a parent or a child? It's fantastic and fun! (Make sure not to leave the shallow shore area alone!) Are you a sunset lover? It's your dream come true! The sand, the ocean, the views, the people, the waves, the surfers, the beer, and the fruits and snacks available, all make it unbelievably unique. In other words, it's a beach for everyone! Just always remember, the ocean is unpredictable and can be deadly, so be aware and alert at all times.

Went to Bali for 4 nights and stay at the Kuta area. Although we were worried for the volcano eruption news of Mt. Agung, Kuta area is far from the volcano and we were safe. We did have the great time shopping and going around the areas like Kuta and Ubud. It was short just 3 full days of touring around South Bali but we did enjoy short break from work
Will visit Bali again soon and this time more days and for sure more areas to visit exploring Big Bali

To be honest, it was a little different from what I thought. It was nice to learn surfing but so many people tried to sell something or offer massage to me. I was tired to say "No thank you" at the end. So it was impossible to have time for relaxing on the beach. The sea was not clean,too.

Kuta beach though little crowded is quite nice as per my views. The sand and water is enjoyable. The colour of the sand is light golden. There are many warungs where one can sip unforgettable bintang radler (my favorite) and watch the sunset. There are some hawkers around who will come to you for selling small stuffs. Those stuffs are mainly cheap but if one do not want to buy them a polite no is enough.

We stayed in kuta for a week and the kuta beach was close to our hotel. We met a great driver there his name is James. He was super polite and considerate and he offered us a fair price. So we spent 4 days with him and we visit different parts of bali . We have him out schedule every day and he drove us to see all those places. He took us to a great restaurant in jimbaran to see the sunset. He took us to a good beach to do water sports. And he took us to get boat tickets for nusa penida.

I like the waves at kuta beach, but it is so crowded there. At the beach, in the water, loads of salesmen (Same everywhere offcourse). It is a populair beginner spot to surf, but to be honest.. only in the white wash is space to surf. For intermediates it is only Nice in the morning, when the rest is still asleep! Way to crowded to take green waves (for us at least) the locals and other more experienced surfers arent really helpfull Or caring over there. The beaches around jimbaran are often better.

Kuta is busy & noisy as all East Asian cities are, but the surfing can't be beat.

As a solo female traveller who loves to surf kuta is great.

Board rentals are ample 30,000-50,000 IND

Perfect for beginners, breaks are off shore.

Stroll onto town for cheaper grub, all the Restos near the beach are insanely pricey.

On a last minute holiday plan, my sister and I settled for Kuta, Bali, given how little time we had to plan. We didn't do any research... it's Bali after all, hello, right?! WRONG! Had it not been for the nice hotel where we could literally hide, the nightmare would have been much worse. What once may have been a paradise, many, many years ago, is now a pit of filth. The beach is dirty, crowded and polluted. Vendors harass you from every direction, anywhere you go. Traffic is impossible. The town is sad and decadent in every possible way. I am so sorry I did not do my homework . I am sure Bali still has many hidden jewels, but I am afraid I may never come back. I don't say cross Bali from your plans, but please do your research and make sure you chose the places that you suit you.

This beach is located on the western side of the island and considered as one of the famous beach resort destination. It just a minutes away from the Ngurah Rai International Airport in Tuban,Bali. Legian and Seminyak beach are just nearby as well, all within close walking distance.

Please make sure to have enough patience because of the rapid growth owes much to visitors, beachcomers and so on... Traffic is become a problem here. Especially during the peak season from July to August and other holiday season.

This long sandy beach has a great waves for surfing (beginners and intermediate), as well as its wild nightlife and nightclubs, and hotels. This is recommended for younger travelers and those on a budget as there is a plenty of cheap accomodation to choose from. This is just a simple and a very easy going place. It offers everything you need as the prices here are low compared to Seminyak.

Living on the Gold Coast in Australia we have great beaches and visiting Kuta beach it was nothing special, the sand is harsh and grainy and the beach itself is dirty, which is a pity.
The beach is a long stretch of beach and there are many tourists, but it is nothing special at all and if anything rather disappointing.

I went to Kuta Beach to surf about 6 years back. The waves are nice. However, the freelance "coaches" are not so nice. Some are pretty rude when you start to bargain prices. Also many are more interested in the female tourists. I hired a coach to teach me how to surf & in the water instead he surfed into my head causing his surf board to hit my head. Not a good place to learn to surf.

Beach was fabulous, just been cleaned from debris after rainy season. Smelled beautiful from al the offerings to the gods that are left at each entrance. These consist of josh sticks and a flower or piece of fruit wrapped in banana leaf. Smells constantly waft across beach and you really know you are in paradise. Indonsian ladys offer feet massages and hand made leather bracelets for less than 50p. So cheap here. Corn is being grilled and offered with a satay sauce. Nice. A gathering of white clothed men in traditional dress are chanting and singing under a gazebo type thing. Drums are going, people dance. Its almost a bit trippy. So absolutely full of activity yet at same time beach is spaceous and quiet.. What a wonderful place bali is. TOILETS are limited, but just pop into hard rock cafe across the road. Get a bintang beer for about 60 p nice. Safe beautiful people the balinese. Gentle. Shame the aussies spoil it a bit by being pissed up everywhere.it is still five stars from me though best holiday i ever went on.

Kuta beach was really nice plenty going on with Surfers on the perfect incoming waves.
In the afternoon the tide went out along way so people played ball games on the sand.
The water is really shallow and safe for children.
You can hire surf boards and tuition.
Also the hire people have drinks for sale and seating available with sun beds if required not sure if these are free if you buy drinks.
All in all we had a lovely time on Kuta beach so will go back another day.

I agree with one of the reviewer. There’s not a minute that we can chill and relax without being harass for surfing class.

Maybe we look like locals or indonesian (all asians look the same) we were charged accordingly. Once we mentioned we were from Singapore and they charged us so much more expensive. We didnt get upset by this but just turned down nicely.

If u want to have a good evening of just chilling out to hear the sound of waves or to enjoy watching surfers go to ULUWATU not Kuta beach.

I understand it was winter time and it's not this community's fault the beach was so filthy, but the truth is, it is the country's fault as all the trash washed up on shore. Indonesia has a cultural problem with trash. That is not to say Bali does, but in general I have been dismayed by how much plastic sits off the shores of Indonesia, especially near Jakarta, which is no where near here, but there is was, anything you could think of in plastic form.

I wasn't impress with the beach as it is a tourist trap. It felt like you could not lay down and relax without getting harass for surfing lessons. It wasn't as clean as I expected. There is fireworks that does give it a nice touch at night. Nice to see if you are in the area. But only a Meh for me.

Crowded and dirty. It was ok to just walk along the beach but much preferred the beach in Legian and seminyak.
Other than that, not very memorable. We started from the entrance at Beachwalk front and ended up around Ramada Hotel/Anvaya beach area. View is better and less crowded (if you're up for the walk there). Can see the plane land from there and a view of the sunset on the rocks

We sat on the beach every after none for a couple of hours we had a couple of drinks right on the beach at a set of plastic tables and chairs named the sunset bar and run by two very friendly locals Wayan and Made .We got to watch people surfing on barreling waves kids playing in the sand an afternoon baby turtle release as well as a number of very interesting other sights the local people are beautiful and friendly and try and sell you various things if you say no there still friendly and will say hi if they see you again but if do buy bartering is a must except for the food NOW THE BEST PART CHECK OUT THIS PICTURE OF THE EVENING SUNSET

The beach at sunset you will get such a breathtaking view. It’s deffo worth a visit during the day or even sunset time. Even if you go during the day there’s so many restaurants to eat in the area and there’s shopping mall as well.

We loved the daily beautiful sunsets on Kuta beach and was great to chill with an ice cold Bintang from one of the many beach vendors that set up daily, we also loved being able to release a baby turtle into the ocean from the turtle sanctuary.
It can become very crowded leading up to sunset but well worth it for the views. The only thing we missed was not being able to have a Sun lounger on the beach to totally relax.

donno why people dont look after Kuta beach this beach is very good spot for sunset. i still remember i came here last year the beach was clean but my recent holiday i found the beach was little bit different. i saw people throwing plastics on the beach. a part from this, Kuta beach still good spot for sunset.

It is a tradition for our family to go to the beach every night to watch the sunset. Kuta is famous for atmosphere and beautiful sunsets. For photos, it is probably close to the best beach, as you can stand behiind one of the palm trees to add that to your sunset pictures. For something a little more peaceful if you are not wanting people trying to sell you massages, shirts, hats etc etc, you would be best to go to seminyak. A beautiful spot, but not as good as Kuta if you are after magnificent photos.

Although it will be EXTREMELY packed, once the sun sets, it’s a totally different experience altogether. If you’re into beaches and don’t mind huge crowds, you will like the sunset out here.

I’ve attached a photograph as well for you all just to give you a glimpse of what it’ll look like.

The beach it’s self was quite rocky in places and definitely more of a tourist beach than an untouched gem. Great choice of restraints and bars along the sea front and fantastic waves for anyone interested in surfing!

What really let it down was the amount of ‘lookey lookey’ people there were trying to sell things to us, they don’t get that no means no! Pleasantly to see and do but not the best beach to relax on.

Kuta beach has it all for surfers and people looking for sun during the day . It's a good place to shop sea shells, you don't get it it at other places in Kuta . They do bargain and you can get at a price not available anywhere .

Great beach full of locals and holiday makers alike. Lots of surfers to watch if you don't surf yourself. Backed by the boardwalk with its many bars & restaurants, but still retains local charm.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,107,40>===============  
The beach is public, so expect a lot of dealers offering their goods and ennoying you with questions.
There is a fine sand and the water is blue and clean. The waves are too big to swim, just to have fun jumping in them.
For surfing the waves are small, so perfect for beginners.( 1-2 meters high.)
Everybody is surfing.
Every 2 meter you have a dealer offering a board for 50 000 rp a day. For lessons you need to pay extra.
If you are young and love watersports, this beach is for you.

We found Kuta Beach to be very busy & not the peaceful day we were expecting. First of all if you want to find a spot in the shade you have to negotiate with the local "businessmen" there who have put chairs & umbrellas there for an hourly rate. Then you're pretty much obliged to buy their drinks as well unless you want to walk to a shop on the street. Then the hawkers selling their goods... I understand that Bali is an under-developed island & their main income is from tourists & tourism, and trust me we contributed in a big way throughout our stay. But on this day when we just wanted to lie & have a calm, peaceful day by the beach & beautiful ocean, they became a bit much. Literally every 5min you will have someone trying to sell you something, and some are better than others at accepting a polite "no thank you".
Also, it may be a great surfing beach but the waves are quite hectic for swimming.
We found a much better beach closer to our hotel called "German Beach". Hardly any people, calm turquoise water, and hardly any salespeople. It's like a scene you would see in a Bali postcard.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,107,50>===============  
I am not a surfer but its nice to watch them go with the waves. We went there just before sunset and i love the view. There are a lot of vendors selling snacks and beachwears and even toys. Good thing the sandbar extends to as far as my eyes can see so frolicking in the water would be fun even for newbies like me. There are surf instructors you can hire and other water activities avbl. Just across the beach are hotels, malls and lots of restaurants.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,108,40>===============  
It's a beautiful beach with fine sand. Very nice to walk on. You'll see tons of people swimming, sunbathing or learning to surf. The only downside is the number of vendors trying to get you to buy something from their stalls. It can become a bit overwhelming.

A very long stretch of sand, presumably the widest beach in Bali. The sand is a mix of yellow and black, so the water doesn't look great. Still, it's fairly clean. A good place for an evening stroll, but be prepared for enormous crowds and a number of glitzy beachside restaurants.

Sitting on the beach on a plastic chair, either in or out of the sun, is a relaxing way to end a day. Watching out over the water, the sun sets before you. Kids running around, surfers, doing exactly that. People walking themselves or their dogs. You can have a beer or not. Your choice, but lovely.

This was a great beach...really clean with awesomely friendly Life Guards :) The beach itself is not too crowded and there are good divisions between swimmers and surfers. The hilight is the sand break and the amazing waves...this beach is great for the beginner to the more seasoned surfer. If you have surfed before skip the lessons and just rent a board on the beach for 50,000..if a novice and the tide is low...do the same and just ask the friendly lifeguards for current and break advice...save yourself a lot of cash. If you want the more social side, join one of the many surf schools. There is also the sea turtle rescue centre there too!!!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,109,20>===============  
Very nice beach and you could have a good time there but as you are constantly harassed (and I use that word in a very strong sense) by people continuously trying to sell you everything ranging from ice creams, henna tattoos, fake sunglasses, bow and arrows, among other crap it is very difficult to get peace and quiet there.

Also noticed a lot of drunk people on beach so definitely not a family friendly place...

Kuta Beach has always been my favorite place to visit regardless of where I'm staying in Bali! There is a baby turtle release is done on kuta Beach everyday between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. depending on the weather, this project is run by volunteers and is free to the public and they do accept donations. And lucky for me my favorites little Beach Bar is directly opposite the turtle release 'Made Jimmy' tell the boys Paige sent you! With extra cold drinks and great prices you can't go past this beach bar. The boys running the ball a fantastic and if you've got little ones with you the boys are very caring and loving they also have kids sand toys to play with. The boys also teach surf lessons from Jimmy's Bar. One thing I love about the spot is anything you need you can get right there on the beach whether it's your hair braided, clothing you looking at buying and just about anything else sold in the shops. I prefer this as I can just sit there having a cold drink and they bring everything to me rather than having to go into the little shops which can be quite hot and tiring and if the girls don't have them on the beach they will go and get it for you. You can also order you lunch from the beach weather its Pizza or any Indonesian dish tell the boys what you're after & the will order it for you and it will be delivered right to you. There are also toilets avalible at a small fee of 3000 ruphia 30cents aussy.
The sunsets here are also to die for!
Depending on the time of the year the beach can be dirty this happens in the storming wet weather as it pulls all of the rubbish up onto the beach but during dry season it is spectacular.

If you surf maybe you will enjoy it but I don't recommend going to the beach, too many people come to sell you things and to bother you. And the sun beds and shades are way to expensive. Better stay around the pool at the hotel.

If you want want to be in the thick of the action or a break from your lovely westernised resort then take a walk down to Kuta Beach, the surf is comforting the beach vendors persistent and the beers cheap. Come down for sunset take a seat and enjoy the experience. Across the road are plenty of eating and shopping options and along the beach a good footpath / broad walk suitable for early morning runs or walks if that's your thing.

A OK beach with lots of flat parts exposed during low tides which great for barefoot running. During high tides the water comes up to the edge of the sloping parts and running becomes a little harder... Lots of hawkers offering you beds, shades, beers, surfboards, whatever rocks your boat. Boys playing football, flying kites, practicing jiujutsu, and much more... If, sometimes, you feel like locals are hustling you too much, just ignore them, they'll leave you alone.

Quiet in the mornings, very busy at sunset. BTW, the famous Bali sunsets are quite spectacular from its western beaches, not to be missed...

Lots of surfers, good ones and plenty of beginners learning the ropes. Tough beach to swim though, with its all-around-the-clock swell and waves.

I really liked sunrise the best, quiet-er, not many hawkers, just people jogging, doing yoga, horseback riding... Really nice.

Also, stop by the Bali Sea Turtle Society and help out release newly hatched turtles into wild... It's located at the southern edge of the Kuta beach and they doing it pretty much daily around 4pm.

Great place if you want to learn surfing. I will try it for my next visit. Get a sunshade and hat. it's hot here. Good place for sunbathing too but too many tourist here. Beware of your belonging. And be careful with the local seller. Sometimes they are too pushy.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,110,40>===============  
We went to the beach quite frequently while in Kuta. There's a ton to do there, from shopping, people watching, surf lessons, etc you really can't go wrong. There will be locals trying to sell you their various wares, but a simple, "no, thank you" and they usually leave you alone. There are various mini "bars" at the back area where you can purchase water, soda, or beer while you relax on the sand. There are also beach chairs with umbrellas you can rent for pretty cheap if you haggle. The water is warm and pretty shallow, the lifeguards will notify you if you are swimming in an area they feel may be dangerous. Don't get upset, they do it for everyone's safety.

You can't go to Bali and not experience a Bali Sunset from one of the west coast beaches.
We were in Kuta for the afternoon so stayed on for sunset from the sand.
Aside from being called Rhonda! And harassed by many bangle, fan and masseurs, it was beautiful.
A cool Bintang and nice young beach boys playing music and enjoying the last of the day. Just perfect.

This beach has the vibe and appearance I sought. I arrived during mid-afternoon and the beach scene was still very active with lots of people present. The beach is wide enough to handle it. It slopes gently into the ocean, mostly, and the surf was very robust. There are numerous surfing tutors up and down the beach and they were kept busy. Lifeguards are present as well as rescue equipment. The walk on the boardwalk has been a highlight of my trip, especially around the mall area. It is more scenic the more you walk toward the rock outcroppings at its end. Plenty of bars, cafes and shops are all around the area, inclusive of a market with vendors on each side if the street. There are shaded area too when one needs a sun break. I loved this beach. OH, AND MOST NOTEWORTHY, the sunset was amazing to observe. Seems to be popular for that activity too.

I rent the longchair for 3 hours for Rp, 100.000 but if you bring any beach towel, you can lay down in the sand. There's a lot of surfing schools that will charge you approximately Rp. 500.000 for 2-2.5 hours.

We reached the beach around eleven thirty and it was already packed with people. Lots of lots of surfers mostly learners I believe.

As you'd probably expect, Kuta Beach is VERY crowded, being the most popular beach in Bali. There's thousands of tourists here and also thousands of locals trying to sell you souvenirs, junk, tickets to tours & activities and lots of other random stuff. There's quite a few beaches around Bali and this would really be the least relaxing or private. But, if you enjoy the tourist crowds and the locals trying to sell you junk every few minutes then this is the beach for you!

A lively place in Kuta with full of activities all the time; best place to relax. There are lot of kiosks providing several drinks with seating arrangements. There is a surfing school too who provides training for the learner. However, there is no shower or change at the beach; toilet facilities are very few.

My wife and I and our middle daughter, along with four other friends of ours, stayed in the Kuta area for two weeks, finishing up there just over a week ago.
On most evenings at about 5 pm, we would head down to Kuta Beach to have a couple of beers or 'cruisers' and watch the activity on the beach and surf and particularly the lovely sunset.
Two of our party tended to go to the same 'Beach Bar' every evening they went down there and we did likewise, by going to Addy's Bar every evening. Addy is a lovely young fella and he had seats set out on the beach for us, every night, even if we didn't appear!
The sunset on Kuta Beachis lovely and there is a hive of activity on the beach and in the surf, every evening. There was always plenty to look at and we never got bored.

It's an interesting place to see and try. a beach full of tourists trying to surf.one annoying thing are all the people trying to sell a bit of anything every 5min.
But it's a mandatory stop in Kuta.
do not spend more than 1-2days there.

The Beach is within walking distance along the Jalan Kartika Plaza commercial area. In the evening it was crowded with tourists. You can sit at the beach to catch the sun set. There are chairs for hire and of course with beers aplenty being sold by the locals. The Beach is also place where people do their surfing.

Kuta is a nice place just for a stop for a few days. If you were looking for nice views and amazing beachs you probably will get a big disappoint. Kuta has structure for tourists and then you can organize nice tripa or just day tours around others regions to have more contact with what the real indonesia is!

This is the main beach in kuta, meaning it is obviously very busy. If you are a surfer then the waves here are great, but for others this beach isn't the best beach. Full of lucky lucky men and not the best sand or clear blue sea. A trip to the gilli islands provides a much better beach.

The extremly pushy and annoying locals who try to sell something drove me absolutely nuts. Every meter, someone walked up, following us, touching us, trying to sell something - anything. It is so frustrating and aggravating that it put a serious damper on our stay in Kuta.

The beach is very dirty and we ended up only going there in the late afternoon to watch the sunset.

We stayed in Bali for one month and frequents of Kuta beach. The local beach boys are very helpful and do their best to make sure you're hydrated . The venders can be very pushy and irritating. I understand they're working but they don't take no for an answer a lot of the time. Stay firm and don't make eye contact. Don't get hustled like many tourists. Oh and never promise them you'll buy later bc they'll just keep coming back reminding you. if you do decide you want to buy something or get a massage or henna make sure you agree on the price before you get it.

Other than that the beach was fun. Plenty of activities like surfing, boogie board, lessons, beach Chairs and umbrellas. The sunsets were amazing on a sunny day.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,116,50>===============  
Since I am Bali and staying near the beach, I decided to have a walk to the beach and enjoy what ever that is there...The Kuta beach is just 50m from my Hotel (Ramayana Resort).

The beach is very clean and beautiful. There a waves that is enough for an ametuer trying to learn how to surf but too small for a professional to enjoy surfing.

A long sandy stretch of beach where you can get a good sun tan if you are into laying on the beach the whole day just to fry your skin. But if you choose to relax out of the sun and enjoying swimming in the beaches, there are nice shades along the beach front with many small stalls run by friendly locals selling cold beers and drinks. Don't expect these drinks to be cheap though. The space in the shades are limited so expect to share tight spaces during peak seasons or timing on the beach.

I was lucky enough to witness the release of baby turtles by a local conservationist group at around 4pm when the sun is going down. Apparently the instinct of the baby turtles is to head for the sun... the will be a large number of people watching this event and a lot taking photographs for remembrance. The representative from the society will ensure that no baby turtle is stolen or harmed by the humans. Sometimes it is annoying because when we are watching the progress of the baby turtles, they can just come and pick it up spoiling the experience and also disturbing photography sessions especially when no one is interfering with the baby turtles.

The sunset on the Kuta beach is wonderful with great colors and if you are at certain parts of the beach you can get a beautiful mirror image of yourself and the sky on the beach reflected like a mirror.

Conclusion:
What is Good?
Clean beach, walking distance from most hotels. Plenty of stalls for food and drinks (local and western). Please of souvenir shopping nearby within 50m radius, you even have a Hard Rock shop selling souvenirs. Plenty of beach activities (did not see any jet ski though). Safe as there are life guards watching the shoreline all the time. A great place for family, lovers and friends. There is no restrictions of what you can wear on the beach and there is no nudity on the beach. Mirror of the sky experience during sunset. Silhouette photography during sunset.

What is Not so Good?
Except for the annoyance caused by the Conservationist interrupting a perfectly good baby turtle run...I can hardly find anything wrong with this beach. If I need to say something, the cost of using the bathroom for shower, washing your feet or human necessities are higher on the beach Rp3000 per entry...normally Rp2000 for public toilet.

It’s a beach, no different than those at Ibiza. There’s a pleasant atmosphere. There are a few people trying to get you at their “establishment”, however never will they try to drag you in there. Surfers and swinmers go criss cross through each other. Some might find this annoying.

Kuta beach is filled with hundred of surfers and the waters are very crowded. Beach chairs cost 150k IDR for three hours. The vendors will charge 200K IDR but negotiate with them. We negotiated everything, including cold coconut which we paid 70k for two cold, boogie board for 50k three Hours.

Kids do play there but be careful of the surfboards. My daughter was hit on the head by a surfboard.

There are areas of Kuta beach that have strong currents so watch out for that. I almost got pulled down with an undercurrent.

The waves make it fun for the children to play though. This beach was funner than Nusa Dua beach. More on that in another review.

We also liked the ice cream vendors. We paid 15k for Popsicle and 25k for Oreo cone. We did get overcharged for ice cream on the first day but second day we paid 40k total or about $3 for the two.

Good sandy beach with surf.The beach spreads for kilometers from Kuta to Seminyak
Be prepared to be hassled by traders wanting to sell you something or offering massages but hey, everyone has to make a living!
The views of the setting sun of an evening are spectacular. They will even sell you a cold beer from an esky for a little over $2aud.
After sunset head off to one of several restaurants
No trip to Bali would be complete without a swim at the beach!

Booked my holiday in Kuta because of its surfing conditions and number of surf schools, but after reading the reviews thought I was going to have holidays in the midst of piles of garbage . Really, it wasn't it!
We stayed in Tuban area and nearly every day walked to the beach and back, entering close to Holiday Inn and walking all the way to the Legian or even further North, so I can say that even in the busy month of August the beach was fine and clean. Of course, some plastic bottle or bag can be found anywhere, but there was no garbage floating in the water etc. Unfortunately, beaches of my beloved South of Italy are much dirtier.
The beach is full of activities, especially around the center of Kuta - you can get surfing lessons, cold drinks, fresh fruit etc. There are also paid toilets, some of them cleaner than the others, along the beachwalk (300k). If you want a calmer spot, with less salesmen (can become slightly annoing around the centre), head North to Legian or Seminyak, there are relatively calm spots there. We used to pay 100k for 4h - two sunbeds and an umbrella, 25-35k for a fresh coconut. On the first days the prices were higher, as for all new commers who don't know what to expect. If you are in Kuta, it's hard not to try surfing, there are plenty of spots, but I strongly recommend Pro surf school, both for beginners and for improvers, they are top!

This is your standard tourist beach. Lots of people surfing - which we did and it was great but also lots of locals looking for work.

They are not rude or intrusive but does get abit wearing having to say 'no thank you' every 5 seconds to a new tout.

To make your way up and down the beach with ease we walked along the path alongside the road and then down along the water. We were still approached but not as much as if you walked amongst the bars. At the end of the day they are only trying to make a living.

Kuta beach probably comes top of my list as the worst beach I've ever been to. It matched Tunisia as my least favourite place in the world. You get hassled every 2 metres by sales people, which is just unbearable.
The beach is so crowded and it's not even that nice.
We stayed to surf and booked with a professional operator pro surf so we didn't have to cope with the harassment that you get on the beach and we hid in our hotel pool for the rest of the short two days we were in kuta.

If you're looking for a nice holiday, don't come here.

So, I have to start by saying that Kuta is not my cup of tea. Not anymore, more than 15 - 20 years. But, if you like crowds of partying youth (wether they are in their teens, 20s or 40s) and lots of hawkers on the beach, moment after moment trying to sell you something, this might be for you.

Kuta is great if you are going to surf and have fun at the long beach, but not if you are going out for a swim.

There are a couple of good restaurants in the area, but also a lot of English/Australian owned sports bars.
Which we talked about is sad, and together with all the souvenir shops, we missed some authentic Balinese restaurants.

Kuta Beach this is where it happens on the beach with $2:50 beers bought to your chair while the essence of everything ever sung about in Bali descends on you to sell you watches, blow, pipes, kites, sunglasses jewellery ...clothing massages...all while drinking your ice cold beer with views of surf volcanos and worldwide tourist encore in front of you.
Tip for Aussies no matter what the all knowing Balinese will tell you Blowpipes and Bows are prohibited weapons in Australia enjoy their sales pitch and leave anything like that .....or made of wood behind. Customs will take your weapons then charge you more than you could imagine for inspecting and fu
I love the whole feel of Kuta beach the mix of cultures as locals get married have funerals while tourists from across the world enjoy usually their first stop in Bali.
If you have not been for a while do not buy anything until you have been in Bali and get a feel for pricing and the barter.
Also get yourself some hand sanitiser on a loop for your belt from the local chemist for $1:50 great for places like this.
Enjoy the atmosphere don't be rude to the locals trying to make a living and respect the beach

Crowded at this time of year but always a great sunset. Be there around 6pm (not too hot) grab a drink and watch the sun go down.

Love heading to the beach to watch the sunsets; lots of beach bars to grab a drink and relax.

We went there last Christmas, stayed at Mercure Legian. Beautiful beaches, plenty of cheap surfing lessons (Compare to Australian dollar). Clean, nice to walk along the beach, BUT too commercial, the people live there tried to sell us stuff even we said no.

Ps: Dont worry about the negative feedbacks, experience yourself. Hope you guys enjoy the beautiful nature.

It's not too bad, just a lot of ppl and bit dirty. That happens whenever it is crowded. Not many public facilities there, and it's a bit gross too. Ok, it's yucky.

On holiday in Legian, we quite often walked down towards Kuta (Kuta beach) to find some sun beds and enjoy the waves.
It really is beautiful here... plenty to do, especially if you love surfing! Most of the bars with sun bed hire are also surf schools/ cafes/ bars etc as well.
The only negative I would say about these beaches are the people trying to sell you things- hats, sarongs, paintings, sunglasses, tattoos, fruit, cigarettes, brackets, manicures, pedicures, massages etc... the list goes on and on...
They are very persistent and quite often want to make conversation with tourists so just be courteous and say no thank you. The thing that broke my heart was seeing the young children selling things too :(

Anyway... the beach itself is lovely. Very soft sand underfoot and the waves are awesome. Even if you don't surf, there's plenty to watch if you're like me and like to people watch. Watching the surf lessons is very interesting! Watching people fall in all
The time is also very humorous!

You must visit at sunset too! There are no words to describe how beautiful this place is at that time. We've also been for dinner on this beach, very romantic! Live music, sat on beanbags drinking cocktails and eating pizza... what could be better?!

Just go for a walk if not to stay all day!
I promise you won't regret it.

The beach is clean and tidy with plenty of drinks stalls but only a few offering food but all offering sunbeds and brollies as with most of the area you will be harrassed by people for hire of scooters taxi's and hats etc. Another thing is being harrassed to go with a rep to a hotel or other to get a free t-shirt or star prize.

Hasn't anyone else noticed how miserable these poor horses are? They are beings, they think and they get scared - just like us, only problem is that they cant speak up for themselves. Take a look at them properly, these businesses are fuelled by tourism, when people decide to get a horse to cart them around the town, think about their welfare. They need proper grass to graze on, time away from the noise and traffic pollution, time to be free from being hooked up to the heavy carriages - they're only small horses after all.

Used to be a magic place
Still a wonderful scenario and to be seen
One of the most popular locations in Bali

Be careful just before sunset you have a great number of local idiots arriving on the beach making pictures of your wife/girlfriend .. so keep your eyes open

No idea why the people that work on the beach do not say nothing about it ... Morè and Morè tourist are being disturbed by this and are looking for a different location.

Maybe the people that run bars and surf board rentals on be beach might have an interest in the pictures differently there is no explanation .... why they do not protect their customers

Being the 5th trip with wife but first trip with family, never cease to impress with the clean beach and cool crashing waves. A seemingly unending stretch of beautiful beach that's accessible by general public, with no hotels fronting this beach is built higher than a coconut tree. Will never get tired of this Beach.

Local tourist here.
Pros :
- Wide beach and coast
- Many stores around here. From beer - fine dining. Anything about locals you can get here.
- Beautiful sunset
- Good place to learn surfing

Cons :
- Overcrowded
- Some locals are scammer
- Actually their water is dirty
- Thief & robbery
- Traffic jam
- There are many beach way better than Kuta.
- It is hard to find parking lot around there (motorcyle is better).

My suggestion if you guys visit Bali, just visit this beach once to watch sunset, that's all. Trust me there are many other beaches or things to do instead visiting Kuta Beach
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,123,30>===============  
I visited the beach around 7:00 in the night, By that time, the beach was deserted and there was very less light. My expectation was that beach will be live all night which was too wrong. The beach is shallow in some places and the sea changes its nature in quite frequently. You can learn surfing here.

Your typical Kuta beach with people trying to sell you everything from bangles to paintings. If you sit on chairs you either need to buy drinks or pay (which wasnt a problem for me) as so hot happy to have a drink. Overall (besides a few very pushy people) the vibe is great and the traders and lovely. Waves were great for my two boys

Went to kuta for shopping
The streets next to the beach are full of these little shops selling you merchandise
Cloth in bali is cheap
Do not forget to bargain
Like it or not the prices halve and sometimes a little less than half too
Bought a wooden Ganesha for 14 USD and a bali bag for 50000 Indonesian rupiah And yes carry Indonesian currency with you
Do not use the money changers there unless extreme emergency else you will get less value for your dollar
Beach had a lot of surfing activity but we did not stop to find that out

If you like surfing then Kuta beach is definitely a place to visit. Personally I really enjoyed long walks on this beach. Locals can be annoying with their sales. About pricing: You should be able to get two sunbathing beds and an umbrella for 100k Rupiah or less for 2 hours of use. Also you shouldn't pay more than 80k Rupiah for one hour of massage per person - they of course try to squeeze more money from you during the massage (which was IMHO mediocre), but you should firmly refuse to pay more than agreed beforehand.

I love beaches with huge waves. I am not a surfer, but I enjoyed the beach, running with the waves. Although sometimes, current gets extra strong so be careful always. But I love this beach so much!

It is not a beach to bathe, nor spend the day refreshing in the water, if it is good for surfing. But strolling through it allows you to see different stalls selling food, fruit drinks and souvenirs. Also the street that borders you have trendy bars to taste a juice or a beer. At night the animation of that area is spectacular.
You should not miss the sunsets

Looks like this was the surfer spot but rented a beach chair for a few hours (200K for 3) and while it was busier than the other beaches you gotta enjoy the banter with the beach sellers.

The male sellers aren't that bad but the women..oh man they don't let go!! Be weary of agreeing to purchase something or their services - once you get one, they'll ALL come over. Do not agree to their initial price (i.e. 300K for a massage....) and keep bantering with them. Yes, all they want is your money and I saw one tourist give a lady a 2K bill just so she would go away - so that's an option for you.

Yes it's ridiculously annoying when you're trying to sunbathe or read and they keep coming up to you but you have to respect the hustle as this is how they make money.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,124,50>===============

Mollys Bar is the best bar on Kuta Beach. Staff are friendly and can not do enough for you. They have surfing lesson, a tour driver, and cold drinks. They also have great singing voices. Once you go there you will return to that bar all the time. Family friendly.

We travelled to Kuta in 2013. Kuta Beach was within walking distance from our Hotel. I recall it being a very busy beach which had plenty of rubbish signs in place for Beachgoers however, I was shocked to see the amount of litter that was on this Beach. It is a stunning Beach but I was turned off by the litter as I felt uncomfortable walking barefoot in the Sand. We really just sat on a lounger and enjoyed the view any day we went there but there was lots of water sports available if we had wanted to avail of them.

The Kuta Beach Sunset is famous and definitely worth seeing once in a lifetime but the Beach needs to be cleaned.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,125,40>===============  
It's a beautiful beach and prim red view at sunset. The beach is great place to surf, the waters are good and safe for kids also, good bunch of tourists around to cheer and enjoy the evening alone and with friends and family.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,125,50>===============  
Best time of the year to travel to Bali as the winds are cool, with temperatures top at 29 degrees.
We brought a little camp tent in case the sun's hot but didn't use it much aside for my mom who don't like to be in the sun.
With 3 frisbees, spades and buckets, the whole family is set for a great day out at the beach. Especially with the beach only 5 minutes away, we enjoyed coming here daily.

We only went to Kuta because I wanted to be a big kid and visit the waterpark...there are definately much better places to visit in bali.
Apart from the waterpark the amazing sunset at the beach would be the only thing else worth going to Kuta for.

It's a lovely beach but defiantly will not get quiet time here as it's very crowded.. Big waves good for surfers. The little kids loved it whereas I like to be quiet at the beach so I'm just fussy. Plenty more coast to explore and hopefully find a quiet spot.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,126,40>===============  
Busy beach but you can find plenty of shade if wanted under the trees closer to the road. Drink and refreshemetn stands all the way along expect to pay around IDR15000 for a drink. The waves are quite big good for surfing. The current it quite strong and pulls you down the beach to the side rather than outwards, not suitale for children on their own.
Nice day out.

=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,126,40>===============  
I have only been to the beach in the evenings. It easy to access being in Kuta, one of the busiest parts of Bali. However, parking and unloading can be a challenge on the small street that runs along the coast.

The beach big as people say, both long and wide. So it does not appear to be crowded. Because the beach faces west, it is a very good place to watch sunsets. There are also a lot of eating locations just across the road such as the Hard Rock.

I am not a surfer so cannot say how good the water is for that activity, but you certainly do see some people on boards in the water.

There are people selling trinkets along the beach, but they are much less aggressive than they were ten or fifteen years ago.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,126,10>===============  
Went to check out the surf, water looked relatively clean, beach was dirty and full of rubbish.
You could sit in chairs if you purchased a drink. While trying to enjoy a drink with family and friends you were continually harassed by the locals selling whatever they could. One lady even started to rub my back and shoulders, when I asked her the price ($45.00 Australian dollars for half an hour) I told her to stop. I had to physically get up from my chair so she would stop touching me.
The view of the water was nice but was not s pleasant stay due to being pestered at every breath.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,126,40>===============  
The beach is actually average the water is not clear but the vibe is just uncanny! Full of activities, surfing, children playing, chairs to rent at the price of a drink - water RP. 10,000.00, softdrinks Rp. 20,000.00 and beers Rp. 30,000.00. Families sit in groups under the shade and watch the sunset, the guys renting the chairs play some music and some of them have a barbeque.
The beach was not trash covered as I read in some reviews, it was clean and this was peak season -July .
The only irritating thing is the Hannah tattoo artists and bracelet sales ladies that constantly approach you.

We walked the beach which was too crowded due to Ramadan holidays but came across the Sea Turtle Society which is very close to Hotel Paradiso.

Very long stretch of beach which is good for a walk or watching the sunset. The waves are more suitable for surfers and not that good for swimming, however the water is warm and ok for a paddle. All of the shade is taken up by vendors and people selling drinks. Don't expect to sit undisturbed on this beach because people will want to sell you all kinds of food/drink/jewellery/clothing/hair braiding/massages/tattoos etc. A polite "No thanks" is advisable unless you want a whole crowd of people around you trying to part you from your money.

Kuta beach amazing sun sets for the romantic

Clean and excellent waiter service with friendly staff overing you a seat or a cold beer. Drinks not over expensive

Kuta beach is pretty long and it is a surfers paradise. It is crowded always! The mornings were very pleasant for the beach walk. It does not have dangerous waves and swimming is relatively safe.

The Beach itself isn't bad, yes there is some debris in the area, what do you expect when thousands of people go there a day. Theread are people who wander around selling things like bracelets, hair braiding, massages, sunglasses, etc. They can get pretty annoying but it you say no and look away they will walk away. The sunset here gets really busy. I suggest getting here early and buying a drink from one of the people with chairs. They are respectful, and let you be once you sit down. The beach can be crowded depending on time of day.

I had heard mixed reviews... Some say that it is full of rubbish and that the sea is unclean, others say it's great for beginers surfing.
I barely saw any rubbish and was really surprised at how well kept it was.

It's a giant strip of beach, so perfect for walks, jogs and finding places to sit or lie. If you're comfortable with bartering, you can get a lounger for about 40k IDR for the day. Or 70k for a couple... Some might get it cheaper!
There are lots of sellers, fake glasses, watches, food, massage and souvenirs. Again, easy to barter down.

The sea is more for surfing than swimming and there are plenty of lifeguards to tell you where you can and cannot swim. The waves are pretty powerful at times.

Kuta beach is a large beach and plenty of space to lay and sun bake but I have to say, it is a little dirty.
There are lots of people selling things and offering massages, they don't bother you so much if you have your eyes closed.
Once you pass the fence there is a wall of seller's offering chairs, drinks, little souvenir's and ice cream.
There is waves and lots of people surfing and body boarding, there is life guards patrolling the beach for safety.
Once you leave the beach, on your way out there is showers and toilets offered for 3000idr.
I was also impressed to see the release of 730 baby turtles back into the sea when I was there.

I'm not a huge fan of beach tho, but I managed to come here to experience the famous beach in Bali. It was too crowded and too many sellers in the day time.

We came here on our last day in Bali to go Surfing and we had a brilliant time.

If you're wanting to go surfing then this beach will be perfect (for beginners as well as more intermediate surfers) however if you're wanting a beach to relax there is a many more beaches that will be better for that.

Kuta beach is also very big so you won't struggle finding an area that is more quiet than other bits. We stayed in the area closest to the mall and managed to get some decent waves and a beer after!

Like I say if you're wanting to go surfing, go for it.. If you're wanting to chill out, maybe go explore elsewhere.

We visited quite a few places in Bali such as Nusa Dua, Canggu, Denpasar etc (our focus was however Gili T, Gili M and Lombok) but I have to say that Kuta is very overrated.

Dirty beaches, fidget spinner sale, haggling in every corner, massage with all possible endings and then some top notch resorts in the middle of this mayhem.

Think that he best days are over for Kuta - it is also used as a bad example on Lombok for how they do not want their island to become.

Loved the Stark Craft beer bar as well as the Aloha Hawaiian restaurant!

We enjoyed this beach. It was a lot wider than Sanur and better sand. There were also a lot of restaurants and even a mall you could easily access.

Went there with my sister but was immediately swarmed with people there selling drinks, offering surfing lessons and aunties selling dresses, bracelets and scarfs. Bought 2 beers and wanted to sit and relax but all of them started coming over. OMG they were so rude and annoying! At first, i declined to buy from them politely but they did not give up and forcefully grab us so as to not let us go. We did henna as we were interested but the other aunties started saying things like, ' you can do henna but why u cannot buy my dress/scarf/bracelets'. The worst was when we were doing the henna and we could not really move as we waited for the ink to dry, 2 aunties came over and started to give us back massages when we did not even ask for it. We kept declining but they continued and us being not able to move fully was annoying as we could not even leave the place as there were around 11 of them swarmed around us. It was crazy!! In the end, the 2 aunties demanded we pay them for the massages. We were so angry finally we managed to leave after being stuck there for 50mins after a kind eurasian managed to pull us out. Our beer on the table was not cold anymore as we could not even drink our beer when they were surrounding us. We did not even go down to the beach area and left after finishing our beer!

The beach is very beautiful and long with great surfing, but it's sooo much tourists here. And with tourists - come beach vendors.. You get interrupted every 10th second. We only stayed here for one night before we escaped to Nusa Penida (heaven on earth)

Quite simply the most disgusting beach I've seen in the world. Raw sewerage was everywhere in the water and most disturbing was the people still taking money for surf lessons.

The smell was awful and the health risks immense. Bali seriously needs to address this issue.

There is very beautiful beach! You can see the best beautiful sunset beach! But there is many seller, and they will bother you... 석양이 아름답지만, 해변가에 있는 장사꾼들의 방행가 좀 있습니다... 서핑을 한 번쯤 도전해볼 만한 곳이로 강추해요~^^ 너무 좋아요 ㅎ

Kuta Beach is a very busy place. People everywhere visiting or selling. Anything you want to buy is on Kuta Beach. Clothes, sunnies, watches, rings, statues, paintings, donuts, ice creams, corn or fresh pineapple and mangos. You can get a cheap beer, massage, pedicure or manicure. Surfing lessons or releasing baby turtles every day. If you looking for a quiet day on the beach this is NOT the Beach for you. Just sit and enjoy. People watching is lots of fun down at Kuta Beach. A must do experience. Go to Eddys Bar for a cold beer and go see Made for a surfing lesson.

Kuta beach is good,nice beach,clean and good hospitality the person working on the beach and beautifull sunset,excelent place for learn how to surf,the problem is the women sales massage,braslet,gaon and sarong,tattoo man,the always rip off the tourist,and also the life guard not consistant to look after people when the tourist swimming they also.
The life guard not profesional and not from the heart for working as to be life guard.
So have to look after u self if u visite kuta beach.

I love walking on Kuta Beach and have done everyday for the past two weeks. The tides are very strong so if swimming do in between the flags. The are a lot of surf schools teaching kids to adults how to surf which is very entertaining and the friendliness of all nationalities walking along are really awesome
There is different textures under your feet some smooth sand some shell grit coral and rocks.

Positives: The view is delightful - both the natural, sea and the very pretty people, male and female adorning the clean beach. There is gentle surfing to be enjoyed not too far out to sea and nearby eating and drinks if required.

What isn't so great was all the hawkers. Being asked to buy an archery set, chopsticks, towels, beads, sarongs etc etc every 3 minutes became a little boring and my partner and I ended up leaving prematurely.

The sand is great, good waves for surfing or boogie boarding, great sunsets, but the touts are very annoying. They push 5-6 times unitl they realize NO does mean NO.

The waves are perfect even for beginners; we had lots of fun with it. You can rent the boards at the beach, but it's recomendable to bring your own.
The sand is thin and a bit dark, good for walks.
It's very busy both on the beach and in the ocean.
Being a public beach, there are vendors constantly approaching you.
Chairs are available for rent, $5 will get you two hours.
Sad that it's a very dirty beach as you get close to the street.

It used to be a great beach, maybe ten years ago. Now Kuta beach is not that awesome since people throw garbage in the sea or on the sand. Hiwever still many people come only to enjoy sunset and beer. Well, I would like recommend this beach when you only want to sit and enjoy the view of the long coast with beer in your hands and some friends with you. It's still a nice place for cheerful and friendly hanging out on sunset time, the locals are really kind and polite.

I must say it is one of the nicest beaches with very clean water and less crowded. Plus main beach area is relatively free of hawkers and other nuisances attached to tourist beaches . Also the beach is visually stunning at sunset time . Sand is soft , water is clean and truely blue the colours of sky at sunset simply beautiful. Also close to air port one can see flights landing on left far end and endless sea n sky meeting beach land mass on right . People are friendly and decent.there are a couple of surfing clubs also which provide basic surfing lessons. A great beach to visit

Beach looks great. But there is a fair bit of rubbish about but more in the sea got caught up on my board leash.
If you go swimming or surfing go steady the currents are strong and rips just appear study the sea before going in the sea can be knee high and waves are 8ft that hurts.

Not an ideal beach.. but a decent one to relax and have a chit chat with your partner/friends! :)

This beach is a proof of tourist congestion. The beach is so dirty and is not what I have expected and locals would ask you every now and then if they can take pictures with you. There's nothing wrong with it but it only distracts you in a way if you wanna relax.

You can also have surfing lessons here for 200,000 IDR, I think it's not that bad, but you must learn how to haggle tho!

Kuta beach may be great for surfing, but there are so many people aggressively trying to sell you things (surf lessons, drinks, sarongs, etc.) . It gets to the point where it's not even enjoyable to stroll along the beach. If you're looking for a relaxing beach experience, this is not the place!

The beach is beautifully clean and a great place to spend the day. The beach vendors are really reasonably priced and offer a bit of shade and an ice cold beer! It really comes into its own as the sun starts to set. We stayed for 5 days and each day gave different colours but all equally wonderful.

It's almost as if a trip to Bali is not really a trip to Bali unless you're brave enough to venture to Kuta and the famous Kuta Beach.

Parked our rental car at Beachwalk mall due to a lack of parking space on the main road. From the mall you can cross the road over to the beach.

The Bali dudes who rent out their sun-loungers are plentiful so take your pick. We paid Rp. 50.000 for 2 (1 umbrella) for 1 hour. The whole hourly thing is new to me, last time I was there it wasn't like that.

However the real lowlight is having to fight off the hawkers and the old ladies were the worst. They don't stop their pestering and it comes to the point of them forcing their services onto you and the result is you have to get mad and give a resounding NO. There is no strength to their massages, if you negotiate a price and you give a big note they will lie to you about coming back to give your change back. There really should be some sort of control over these people because it would really make me think twice about ever going back.

If you can get past that, the beach is always busy with tourists, kids and surf lessons. The beach is not that dirty it is more that the water picks up the sand and just looks dirty. Sand bar is nice for the kids to walk on.

Halfway Beach is found literally half way between Kuta and Legian. Its a great spot. There is Halfway Bar - Kutuk runs this. He is a very friendly man. Very cold beers for 25000 approx $2.70 each. Mandi 14 is also very friendly and she gives a great massage at only 50000. She is in this area. If you want your nails done Debbie is there. Surfing comps are held along this stretch. We saw one sponsored by Hurley.

It's very happening and busy here with lots of street vendors. We were here to release the sea turtle with our kids. We planned on playing on the beach, but our kids complained because their feet hurt from walking on the coral/sand!

Went to this beach once and didn't stay longer than 10 mins. Great for surfers but to relax it's impossible with locals trying to sell you things every 2 minutes. The current in the water is too strong to even paddle and compared to other Indonesian beaches it's not worth going. If in Kuta, stay somewhere with a pool and save the trip to the beach.

This was a very diverse beach. We rode bikes up and down the Kyra beach boardwalk . Amazing . Incredible shopping Sunbathers hotels massage areas surfers restaurants . Has it all.
Great sunsets too.
We did swim and enjoy the surf. Even got to release baby leatherback seaturtles into the ocean . Only 4 hours old. Truly epic.
Stop for some cold beers of Bali Hai or Bintang .
You will love it. Cheers :)

Local peddlers won't stop pestering you like flies. I don't feel safe here let alone comfortable. Some were very insistent to the point of annoying.
What was more hurting was some of them were not friendly to Indonesian tourist. We're Indonesian, and this is our country, and they are fellow citizens, and yet they treat us like second class citizen. So much for patriotism. A real shame.

All prices were ridiculously a rip-off. We end up only bought 1 coconut drink which is terribly priced 25 K IDR. That is about twice higher than the price of coconut drink in Jakarta.
In Jakarta, a typical coconut seller will help you choose their best coconut. And there're also take aways available. They will scrape the coconut for you, and seal it in a plastic bag along with the milk if you want to take it away. In Kuta, the seller will coldly told you to select what you want without giving any advice. When they were asked which to choose, the answer is choose at your own risk. Whoa... And if you want to take the coconut drink with you (i.e. when you're going to other place), the seller will told you to bring the whole coconut with you... omg!

Kuta is a beautiful beach but too many uneducated peddlers. The local government should really take some measure to manage the site more comfortably and to give more and more education to the locals.

Kuta Beach is more known for pvt beach resorts. It is more secluded & quietfull than seminyak beach. Not many options of open air restaurants here as most restaurants are part of resorts & hotels, though you can dine here. The best part is the track next to sea where you can walk, jog & cycle from one end of airport to Discovery mall & upto Seminyak beach. It is best for cycling & long walks. Though you can swim here but wont recommend it as water here is sandy, rough & rocky at times. View of airlines landing & sunset are the best features of this beach. If you want privacy & peace, Kuta beach resorts are for you.

This beach was overrun with hustlers 25 years ago; today the picture is no better.

It's a hot spot for rough Australians and low cost backpackers covered in tattoos and intense tans who have no interest in visiting a foreign country and simply want to party in a hot climate with no consequences.

Some people like me tend to avoid crowded beaches, which is why in the many times I've transited through or visited Bali, I've come to Kuta beach only twice. But both times, at different times of the day and week, were low-key, which makes me understand that Kuta beach has its lull periods once in a while too. The first time in Sept. 2015 was late afternoon during the work week, and the second time was this last Sunday evening during End of Ramadan weekend when many local shops and eateries were closed. It's a nice place to people-watch and just observe day-to-day scenes, is pleasant during the day and in the evening, and both locals and visitors go. It's not a white sandy beach though, if that's your usual image of a nice beach. There are other much nicer beaches across Indonesia, as I've seen for myself and also heard from some Indonesians that said this beach isn't really for locals and doesn't really show how serene and pristine Indonesian beaches can be. But it's the well-known beach in the well-known place, so still come by if you can, and see for yourself.

We did not swim, mainly because we have been swimming everyday elsewhere. But we walked a fair distance along the beach. It was busy. Lots of families. Swimmers, surfers, kite fliers... everyone seemed to be having fun. The beach did not look as dirty as I remembered it from our visit 12 years ago. Good for a visit and a swim, but if your hotel has a pool that might be a better option.

I stayed at Hardrock Hotel and the beach was just across the hotel. Kuta is not my most favorite beach because it used to be more crowded compares to other beaches. However, we were there during the fasting period so it was less crowded which was good. Normally I would be annoyed by those people offered some services along the beach (eg massage, braiding hair, beach cloth) but this time I was looking for someone who could teach my 11-year-old boy how to surf. It was the life guard himself who offered the service which was half price compares to the offer from the hotel for 2 hour lesson (ie USD 15). For additional of USD 10 we could also have some great pics of my boy surfing in the ocean in CD format. My boy enjoyed the activity so much.

The Cons:

Despite a diverse range of reviews of Bali-Kuta myself and my family decided that " it can't be that bad ". Booked to stay here for a week as part of a month vacation and after three nights we are GLADLY leaving.
We are very custom to people trying to entice you into their shops and persistently trying to sell you stuff . But this is a whole new level by local men not only doing this but also who "purrr" at the woman in your family , dog whistle and " baby want a free massage " ... INFRONT OF THE WHOLE FAMILY. The beach is beautiful but ruined by people trying to sell you stuff constantly and the pollution. There is rubbish and rotting food EVERYWHERE .
If you are a westerner , how we view Benidorm and Magaluf is how the Australians view kuta & seminyak. The place we stayed and it's pool was the best thing about the three days . However the constant beeping of horns and the gridlock traffic right outside the pool area isn't a negative as such but hardly the peace and quiet we were expecting.

Overall the decision to cut a week stay by four days and loosing £350 to the hotel is a lot more appealing.

The pros : If your a young group of lads the beer is cheap , the woman plentiful ( and cheap ) the bars open 24 hours .

Kuta beach is a vast beach and mostly people other for surfing because of its high waves. You can see many surfers surfing and even if you want to try your hand on it you can have trained instructors who can give this experience even if you have never tried before. As they are having there small shops open air with surfing boards and with help you can do the surfing. Absolutely up to you for this decision. In the eve people go there for a walk and enjoy the scenic views and sound if splashing waves. Kuta beach is a happening bea h as across the road there is a huge market place which separates the beach by stone walls. So you can enjoy food, shopping, many restaurants,hotels have live music till 10 pm. You can enjoy beach walk at night without getting disturbed. But in day time lot of vendors with pearl jewellery, foot massage and many other sovenier kinda thing are after you to buy their stuff or get a massage. So that's really irritating. But even after all this Kuta beach is a beautiful happening beach.

Kuta beach is probably Bali's most prominent beach. However the sand quality isn't as pretty as some other beaches in the island. However the waves makes it a perfect spot for surfing. The restaurants as well as some shops nearby makes the area good for a walk.

The beach is wonderful in Kuta, powerful waves created some action in the sea and surf is everywhere! My husband and I enjoyed watching the surfers, jumping the waves and snuggling up for some romantic sunsets. The sellers can get a bit much, we found ignoring them does work as no isn't in their vocabulary. You have to visit the turtle society if going and walk along to the end of the beach to discovery mall! Crazy waves outside there with stunning evening views.

Even if you don't want to swim or surf this is one nice beach to just hangout. You will have locals coming up to you to sell things. Give them a firm no and you are okay.
Leave your belongings at the hotel if you want to relax. This way you don't have to keep an eye on your things.

Got to Kuta from Benoa by taxi which was an interesting experience as far as sights and noticing the 'following' of driving rules goes. Once there the beach was alright but not what was really expected as there was quite a bit of debris/rubbish around.The atmosphere there was unique in so far as there were many tourists, many vendors right on the beach and many locals yet it all seemed quite relaxed. Many vendor stalls sold drinks which you could sit down on the beach to enjoy but, as was found out, once seated other locals would come over offering anything from clothing to massages to manicures to jewellery to braiding to tattoos. It did become a little annoying after a while but at the same time it did make this a unique experience.

Nice and busy beach with lot of tourists. Lot of vendors selling drinks etc. Not too many options for snacks or food. Coconut water was highly over priced at the beach it seems I was unable to strike a good deal.

A nice beach if your accommodation is near by, but doesn't deserve to be visited if you live far away.
Crowded a bit but not that annoying.
You'll need to deal with the bad habit of pedlars nagging around insisting to sell you nonsense stuff.
If you're a surfing lover you'll love this beach.

Pros: nice beach w a beautiful sunset. Beer/drinks are also readily available if you like as well.

Cons: you get ABSOLUTELY hassled from people wanting to sell crap and they are relentless.
As funny as it is at one stage a lady came up and began cutting my friend's toe hairs for some money without even asking.

If we didn't have a friend who serves us Beer on the beach, we wouldn't bother going. Plenty of other beautiful beaches to go to that don't come with the hassle.

We were warned that it can be crowded and crazy but we didnt think it would be that much. Well it was a bit true. You can't have a peaceful walk by the beach because people kept asking for surf lessons or a spot in one of the sunbathing chairs.

We just wanted to actually look at the people surfing and just walk casually on the beach.

Waves were a bit strong, good for surfing but not so much for swimming.

The best part was having the best of luck witnessing baby turtles being released out on the sea! They were so many and so tiny.

Kuta beach is a nice place to go however be prepared to get hassled pretty much every five minutes by locals trying to sell things. Whilst walking down the beach you will get asked 'surfing surfing?' Or something similar, and let's say you reply 'no thanks', a person stood literally 100cm away who has just seen you say no thank you will ask the same thing. Alll the way down the strip. I don't really mind them because they are only trying to make a living but if your not one for being bothered then you should probably avoid this beach.

Thankful for a nice sunny day after a couple days of rain. This made the beach so inviting. We walked along for about 100m before settling down under one of the umbrellas (weren't keen on swimming) for some Bintang (30k for the small ones). Just watched the surfers go at it and some kids play at the edge of the water.

Watch your kids!! The waves at Kuta are very strong and we saw some bulking, sturdy looking grown men being knocked over by the waves hitting the shore.

Don't entertain the people selling stuff if you don't want to buy. Once you are interested in one they will keep coming.

Overall a clean beach with the odd plastics here and there. Pick stuff up, chuck them in the bin. Let's do our part to keep this beach the way it is.

Oh mind you this was not peak season so we got some clear views/pics of the water. No such luck in July/Aug according to the vendors there. Good luck!

It's close to the main hotels in Kuta, so seems like a good option at first glance.

However, wether it's the surf you're after or more of a family retreat, there are other options in Sanur, Ahmed, Ulawatu or nusa dua.

This is a good spot to watch the sunset prior to the partying in Kuta, not much more.

We had a trip to Kuta and part of this was to see the sunset. We got to the beach just after the tide had gone out a bit and about an hour before sunset originally. It was an attractive setting even with the sea not close. The trees at the back of the beach and all the stalls, and seats awaiting the sunset were just great. The people were really good having a joke on with you and it was clear many were surfers who had probably been on the beach and surf a lot of the day. We walked along the beach a few hundred yards from where we first accessed the delightfully smooth sand and saw many differing things. People of all ages enjoying the beach in all sorts of activities. From the vendors/surfers at the back to the surfers on the water. Fishermen to tourists to groups of school children all very happy to get in on a selfi. They were great and we had plenty of fun getting them to shout and jump for the cameras etc. On settling down to watch the sunset the local surfer chaps provided us with a seating area and a cold Bintang. Relax and enjoy we thought and that is exactly what we did. This was an amazing sunset with the orange skies simply delightful. It seemed to go on for about an hour, whilst we relaxed and enjoyed the beer. Cracking beach, great atmosphere and a sunset to travel the world for. Great beach even though we didn't swim and the tide was out when we visited. It seemed pretty clean to me by the way.

In all of Bali, there are many beaches, all of whom are quieter and in some ways better scenery wise than this.

But what separates this beach is that it is the best place to surf and catch those athletic humans in action. Plus with the airport on your left you can catch the planes as well. Overall it is the rush, the crowd and the resourcefulness of this batch that sets it apart from the rest!

I had never stayed in Kuta before and like to stay in different areas, I had heard quite a lot of negative feedback regarding Kuta in general.
Needless to say, I was impressed.. I absolutely love the Save Bali's Sea Turtles on Kuta beach, they collect the eggs then let the public release them back into the sea after hatching,,, great job!! We actually sat on the beach had a couple of drinks while chatting to fellow travellers and the locals coming up and asking if you wanted ⌚️ perfume, clothes, sarongs etc.....
A must for people to experience at least once......

Typical beach like any other public one. Difference is that here even newbies can try their hands at Surfing. Board with an Instructor for one hour at very affordable rates. Lots of boards for everyone. Kids had a blast. Waters are safe...unpredictable tides -- Sometimes rough. Lifeguard presence till Dusk. Unfortunately - after 2 days of sheer fun and frolic...the third day - something was wrong. The Plastic and Garbage in the water seemed to have trebled in quantity. I couldn't stand in the water more than 10 seconds without trash hitting me ... It was sooo bad .. we had to leave the water and the beach. Hordes and tonnes of garbage washing ashore as if someone had just dumped truckloads of it in. Sad -- The beach needs urgent attention - Hope the authorities are listening - Otherwise the place will die out very soon !!

Was here to watch the sunset.
As the waves are strong and big here so surfers are a common sight.
There are definitely beach goers but not overcrowded. There are also local vendors around selling shawls around for you to sit on while there or just wear it around.
A good place for sunset, people watch or just a good leisure.
It was slightly cloudy but the sunset was still beautiful and just an extra charm for the beach.

Kuta beach is not good enough for a holiday I think, because Kuta beach is very crowded and not clean enough, Kuta beach also needs more public facilities, such as toilets. And for the cleanliness, Kuta beach needs more janitors to clean up the beach and around Kuta to make tourists comfortable. lastly Kuta beach needs more signs for the cleanliness and safety

If you are interested in spending some quiet time in a clean beach area then this is not for you. Kuta is more of a CITY BEACH. Sunset view is great. Surfers will also like. Plenty of options for people who like shopping. From one side to another you have so many restaurants and shops. Discovery mall is right across.
But the beach is horrible. Sand is dirty and there is rubbish lying everywhere on the beach. It’s more like a market on the beach. Too much crowded and people will continuously haggle you. No matter what you say they won’t leave you alone.
Water quality not the best. Just dip your feet in the water and that’s the max we could go. Drain run offs on the beach from the streets and smelly. This beach is overrated like most places in Bali. There are many other beeches in Bali which is clean and bit more calm and quiet. Try elsewhere if you need peace and a good relaxing holiday.
Try Kuta only for a day to get the experience of shopping and beach walk. Nothing spectacular here.definitely not a 5 star rating as others had mentioned. But then again it’s a person to person thing. Everybody’s taste is different.

Everytime i visit bali i'll definitely will go to kuta. You can swim, surf , sunbathing , jogging, walking and maybe just enjoying the sunset. The sunset for me is the best among all the beaches in bali. Bali is not bali without Kuta beach, so you should not miss kuta in your list while in Bali.

This place is a mess. My husband and I walked along the beach as well as the walkway and didn't find anything attractive at all. Trash is everywhere and we were pestered by person after person trying to lure us into an obvious scam. They just wouldn't take "no" for an answer. The views from the beach are nice but nothing special. We saw several surfers trying to catch a wave but they were way too small. Outside of this, we didn't observe anyone in the water and very few were sitting on the beach itself. Too bad because at one time, I bet it was a special place.

We were a bit apprehensive about going to Kuta Beach. Not far from our Hotel but we're pleasantly surprised. Last time we were harassed by multiple people and followed to buy things. Left quickly.

How can people give such a dirty, dog poo infested beach a rating of 5?
If its not the flies swarming because of the drain run offs on the beach from the streets or dodgy sewer runs, its the locals offering tat even as one local has just left.
its not sand that you wipe from your feet its cigarette butts or dog mess.

Kuta is a great beach but it's a bit more like a market on the beach.

Lots of hagglers 'sarong sarong, bintang', beachside restaurants, surfing companies and pop up bars.

Actually i was really enjoying stunning view of Kuta Beach, but after some ladies ruin my day by forcing me and my friend to buy their service like massage and nail art (which I thought the price will be average price in Indonesia) they charged us for quite large amount. Be careful of these ladies, make sure you ask and deal with them before they forcefully give them their service to you.

Kuta Beach is the best place for surfing, the big waves and the big beach so can enjoy and have fun the whole day. If you are not a surfer, it is no problem, relaxing and lying on a big beach chair, you can enjoy and follow the many surf lesson given on the beach. There are many off Surfing schools or the young local boys who are working on the beach, they like to teach you also how to surf. If you are in Bali, you have to be in Kuta Beach.

Not a fantastic beach, but it works. Usually there are a lot of waves so bathing is not for everyone. Also, there are a lot of surfers so watch out so you don't get a board in your head!

On the other hand the beach is way better if you like surfing. Lines with surf-stalls where you can rent boards for around 40K RP an hour. (Cheaper if you rent them for more than one hour).

Also a lot of places to chill and have a beer or other refreshments.

Just walking distance from we stayed, Kuta Beach is a great place to relax and simply watch the waves and the surfers while waiting for the sunset. Even with a lot of people/ tourists, the place is not overwhelmingly crowded. You will always find a spot to sit and enjoy the view...
There will be people offering different things - beer, massage, playing cards, hair braiding and more - but they do not insist. Near the beach are local warungs you can choose from. The beach is also close to stalls that sell souvenirs.
Love the place!

If it is your first time here, the price offered is always is too high. They will ask you to offer, so if you have not done your research, you will be none the wiser.

All the vendors will descend upon you and will not leave till you buy something from EACH of them or you outlast them by ignoring them (which can kind of ruin a peaceful experience at the beach).

If you know the cost of stuff (beach chairs, day beds+umbrella, massages, pedicure, manicure, tattoos, beers, hats, wrist bands, towels, tank-tops, etc.) that's good. Otherwise, unless you are interested either in the items or in supporting local industry, you can just keep rejecting the offers or solicitation. They are persistent and they will descend upon you altogether, so you need to be just as firm. If this stuff bothers you a lot, then you might jus want to avoid this area unless you just want to experience it just for the fun of it.

So, beware, but at the same time, enjoy yourselves.

We had beer from a very friendly drinks vendor, Harley Bar (just in front of the Sheraton). We, 8 of us, had a good time.

If you want to be constantly bothered by people trying to sell you anything from hair braids, to fake products, to massages, to surf lessons 'very cheap', come here. The beach is your typical city beach consisting of a lot of trash and too many people. Everything is over priced as well as not as enjoyable or tasteful when it comes to food.

The one good thing I can say, is one out of the million of beach bars in Kuta, there is a fantastic one run by a guy named G'Day. He is super friendly and sells beer cheaper then most on the beach. The beer is cold and the chairs in the sun or shade, whatever you prefer. He is located close to the Beachwalk, on the beach in front of a Circle K and Starbucks.

For a beach in a very touristy seaside city it is quite clean. There are many tourists but a nice beach for a swim and to have a drink. You can rent a chair if you buy a drink. Many vendors and markets near there. Is entertaining to watch the surfers. This beach is good for beginners so many surf lessons offered. If you want total quiet it is not the beach for you. But as older"backpackers" retired persons, my husband and I enjoyed the beach and a swim.

I guess if you decide go to Bali you have to stop in Kuta. It's full, full of everything; motorcycles, cars, people and carrieges.
I think It's a good first stop in Bali, but you have to run away if your world is not the surf. You will find more interesting Ubud and all the traditional culture there, and all the beaches are around.
If you stay there, see one sunset, it's a magical moment.

Kuta Beach is a long stretch of beach and it gets packed at times. It is ok but nothing special. I guess with some great beaches in Australia I am spoilt as beaches like this arent particularly appealing as the sand is dirty and there is rubbish lying about.

Kuta beach does not need any introduction. Its a very popular and crowded beach. But it is definitely not a super beautiful beach. So keep your expectation low.

For a beach that is one of Bali top features, it's a borderline sewer. There is garbage everywhere. I wouldn't set foot in the water. Such a waste.

Kuta beach is ok, but overrated like most places in Bali. The main reason Australians come here, is because it's close to us and cheaper than most holidays in Australia. But even here in Bali the prices are rising, and a lot of places and some outlets are charging US Dollar. Because it holds greater value, although still a cheap holiday and people still return year after year. I always look for a new adventure.

Been coming to Bali for 12+ years and probably avoided it the first few years because of how full on and crazy it can be but the more you come the more you embrace the craziness of it all. If you find a good place to sit and just enjoy, say no and you get left alone. Or just enjoy the massages and manicures and shopping all coming to you. We always sit and Han & Tonys Bar just past the turtles and always have a good time. If you want something to eat they will happily go and get something for you and the satay you can get is awesome, so much better than a lot of other places you can go and for only 35k. A must do on your Bali trip I think!

Disappointing after reading hundreds of 5* reviews. There probably are some stunning beaches across Bali but the Kuta beach definitely isn't one. Locals are ridiculously annoying around the beach (don't tell me about culture, habits, tourism and everything, that constant harassment every 5 minutes, and from the same people again and again). Long stretch of beach but dirty at most areas, water was warm and shallow but really dirty - too many plastic bags and all sort of things I would rather not ask what they were. Go Lovina beach if you can or look for other bays nearby, preferably far from the main tourist areas and towns.

Visited Bali in may 2017 with my family and my friends family... well to say the truth I was a bit disappointed with the beach.. specially considering the rave reviews I had heard about the same ... the stretch was littered with waste food materials and packets.. and the locals were also a bit harassive.. even the chairs and the worn out loungers put up in the beach were being rented at a price and the overall ambience hardly gave a premium
Feel... I also noticed a lack of adventure sports .. maybe I was unfortunate..

We have spent 4 days at the beach surfing. There was excellent waves for around 2 to 3 hours. If you want peace this is not the beach. So many people throng selling ice creams, beads, hats. Even while surfing you might hit on someone as you surf.

Since Pantai Kuta or Kuta Beach is a very famous beach in bali, so whenever our family go to bali we must visit kuta.
The beach is nice, esp in the morning and sunset time. Beautiful
Love to be here because there are so many shops, cafes, art markets, malls, so you will feel everything you need are there.
Interesting.

Best time best atmosphere
Beer are cold sellers are pushy
This is bali tourism at its busiest. Anything that you could want to but from mimco bags, makeup, wood carvings, silver, hats, sunnies, watches and just about anything else. If sellers don't have they can get for you. Only downfall was small children selling braclets/anklets for 1 dollar. When we kindly declined walked away speaking Indonesian. Don't speak the language but I am sure that it wasn't nice words that were said.

Nice to walk along in the evening when its both cooler and the rubbish is not as obvious. Grab a beer and snack under the trees as the sun sets on the wave tops. Relaxing!!!!!

Kuta was one of the first resort villages in Bali. Legian and Seminyak are more upscle. Kuta Is Mass tourism beach with lot of hawkers. MAN I know was robbed while sitting in the evening at the beach.

I think the beach is good for surfing! Rough waves. A bit pricey cu of the location. Buying a drink or a snack or even accessories or hats from the sellers is highly NOT recommended. Just buy anything you need before entering.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,149,20>===============  
Tips 1: wear lots of sunscreen
Tips 2: if you cant stand heat n are not there to sun tan, dont go from 11 to 2 pm on a hot day. The sand is hot enough maybe you could boil your coffee.
Tips 3: check the weather forecast, if you are a surfer you know what to do. Some days the sea level is good enough to provide with good waves sometimes it dont.
Tips 4: know how to bargain. You have no surfboard n you wanna rent one, there are many along the coast. You just need to bargain, some rent it cheaply to 120k rupiah including surfing lesson some to 200k rupiah. This tips applies to all the things they are selling or renting there.

Good things: The beach connect to Segara beach and Legian beach, right in the middle. Near beachwalk shopping centre and lots of restaurants n small shops n hotels. Bustling from dawn to dusk.

Meh: water not crystal clear. A bit of trash here and there. You might think i'm crazy, but i think the sand in Kuta is harder than the one in Legian beach. I like a more squishy sand sooo....
Kinda overrated. Too many people selling stuffs.

Biggest advice - hit Kuta very early at sunrise and join the locals and others as they wake up with a bit of beach walking or exercise. You will see it before the heat, and the madness of the hawkers of the day arrive to hit up tourists for massage, manicures, pedicures, hair dos and more. If you want to get hair braided or nails painted head there during the day. There is often action and activity going on at the South end. If you are the kind of traveller that likes boulevards of shopping and hotels and tourist attractions.. the South end is where you might want to hang out.

Great place to people watch and have a swim. Plenty of hawkers up and down the beach but not too pushy. Cheap beers and snack foods. Recommend you get onto the Turtle rescue / release page of FB to see when they are releasing baby turtles back into the wild. The kids can release day old turtles back into the water for a dollar and its a great experience. Just up from the main gates at the further est most point of the beach opp McDonalds.

This has to be one of the worst beaches I've ever been to. The sand was dirty & rubbish scattered around. I was continually harassed by the locals following me, trying to get my attention & sell me things. They even continued after I had said no. I stayed across from Seminyak Beach & it definitely wasn't as bad as Kuta Beach. It was my first time to Kuta Beach & definitely my last.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,150,20>===============  
I was saddened by the amount of garbage washed up on the beach. Random flip flops, plastics, a light bulb, natural debris (sticks?). There were crews cleaning it up in the morning, but I chose to stay by the pool rather than what I had pictures to be lovely beach.

Traffic along the strip is chaotic. For the week we were in Kuta (after 3 tranquil days near Ubud), we didn't get in a vehicle until we went to the airport. This meant we also didn't get to some of the restaurants we would've liked to try, but stuck within walking distance of our hotel.

It depends what you are looking for, but I have some regrets that we didn't choose a different beach location.

It was on our last day of honeymoon that we decided to visit kuta beach and it was after checking out from our hotel! The place is kind of near to airport so i would say it was a best choice that my husband made at the last moment !we kept our luggauge in one of the showrooms in the discovery mall (thankfully someone agred to keep it) and had a great time enjoying the sunset at the beach! The place was crowded and had lots of families with kids and was surely a lively place to visit. A lot of restaurants are there facing the beach and most of them were very reasonable.I suggest the mall to keep a locker room for the lugguage so that most of the travellers will find it convenient to shop and yea...you get a looot of goodies and soverigns to shop here at the discovery mall near to the beach! :)

Kuta Beach is right in a busy road of Kuta. Shops, cafes and hotels are all around its vicinity which makes it an ideal place for those who seek convenience but tranquil at the same time. Part of the Indian Ocean, it is very calming watching the waves of the beautiful sea. Besides, one will enjoy watching surfers breaking through the waves and closer to the shore, holiday-makers enjoying swimming in the sea.

The beach itself is ok, nothing to write home about.
But beware that you will be harassed from the minute you get on it to the minute you get off. It really stressed me out.
We got approached so often and said 'm thank you' hundreds of times that day.
One person my sister said 'no thank you' to 12 times before i lost it and said 'she said no thank you. What don't you understand?' They laughed but finally got it.
We never went back to the beach.

Kuta beach is just an add-on for the town that's crowded every single day. It's not clean and tidy, sea is far from crystal clear as you'd maybe expect and the surrounding isn't appealing at all. Semynak is a bit better but try som other beaches like Dreamland or Virgin for a good experience.

Seriously, it depends on your desire. If you stay near the beach like somewhere in Bali garden beach resort or discovery resort you'll get some serenity, but if you are not then it's very crowded and a lot of people just going around. Good for premitive learner surfing but not so much in down tide. Wait til it's high tide. Around morning you'll get that. After jogging perhaps. Afternoon it's noisy and everyone will call you if you need anything or not but early morning it's good. You know locals are just trying to make a living... Before 9am it's calm.. With kids it's A+ but for honeymoon, forget about it.

Great surf beach if you surf I don't but it looks spectacular more spectacular on the clear days is the setting sun. Get yourself to a beach bar we go outside Bali Sea Turtle Society to Made Jimmy's bar and wait for the sun to set whilst sampling a few cold ones. If there's a little cloud in the sky watch the colours after the sun has set the sky goes amber and sometimes red as if in fire.

I may be super critical as I first visited Kuta beach in 1980. But Kuta beach is totally spoiled by so many unprofessional traders and the beach having been very dirty. No wonder any experienced Bali traveller avoid Kuta beach.

We visited Bali to experience the island, the people, the culture and the scenery. Beautiful sunset on a beach somewhere or atop the cliff at the temple. For 2 days we were waiting in vain as the sun started to descend before the clouds engulf it into the darkness.
We headed to Kuta beach twice, at noon with the sun high above us and the blue water over white sand beach gave us the feeling of serenity amid the busy street just outside the walled beach area, and again close to sunset, as the sky display so many different colours before, during and after sunset. There are few stalls offer cold beverages and chairs to sit and enjoy the view, the sound of the ocean and people chatters in the distance. The prices are reasonable, and the lady who owns the stall is an ecology and environmentally aware person. She talks to her customers about not chucking empty bottles and cans and other rubbish on the beach.
There are some ladies offering souvenirs with reasonable prices or open to bargain in friendly manners. Some could be persistent, but most will leave you alone if you told them no thank you, as polite as you would be treated if the role is reversed. All and all, it didn't disappoint and we wiill always come back to Kuta beach for the sunset.

Completely full of garbage. While swimming, you will feel all kind of things scraping your legs and when the tide goes down, you'll find out what was it. Check the pictures... DISGUSTING!

Okay firstly I can't bad talk the locals as it is their country but if you want peace and quiet on the beach this is not the place to go. You'll be lucky to go 5 minutes without being approached by someone selling anything from sunglasses to massages. You'll have to pay if you want any sun tanning beds, umbrella shade etc anywhere along the beach. The water is dirty - I would blame it on the weather bringing through brown water but the amount of litter in the water shows that it is not hygienic in the least. Beach bad signs up stating no swimming along due to the conditions this is the only reason I haven't given it 1 star, use your time somewhere like Gilli T if you want to spend time relaxing on the beach.

I know that's what you expect coming to Bali and everyone has different experiences but I don't like my family being followed and having to say no thank you numerous times to the one hawker (each time).

This is a nice beach location and attracts those keen on learning to surf. It is very close to a main shopping center and key food outlets, such as the Hard Rock Cafe, McD's, KFC and Pizza Hut. I would advise anyone visiting that the sand gets very got during peak times and I felt like my feet were burning at the soles trying to walk on it. Flip flops would definitely be recommend. Furthermore, when sweaty the sand sticks and seems impossible to remove. I think I brought half the beach back to my hotel! The beach is a long stretch and ideal for an evening stroll gazing at the stars.

Kuta is a big area and even the beach is quite a long stretch so be selective where you stay. Choose Hard Rock hotel to enjoy the crowd. Stay near Pullman hotel if you want a quieter area. Either way the worst part of Kuta beach is the traffic. Perhaps you 'd want to stay in Legian area instead.

The beaches in Bali are the worst that I've seen and I've seen most.

They are all the same. Filthy, dirty, full of litter. The water looks like it's got raw sewage loading and crashing in the waves.

This beach is everything you want.
It is long. Full of sand, not a bunch of rocks. It is not getting deep fast, it is a very small decline. The waves are usually very good for surfing, and there are lots of guys wanting to teach you. Beware of expensive prices though!

The sunset here is the most beautiful thing like ever.

The only downside is that the beach is full of people trying to sell you things. If you know how to bargain you can get good things for a reasonable price, but for the most part it is just annoying.

Also sunbeds are there for rent.

This beach has a lot of activity .. the water has a bit of current so make sure you swim between the orange and red flags.

It's a great place for surfers who just want to start up. For roughly $15 I managed to get myself a lesson and even managed to make it to the beach on the surf a few times. The people there are very friendly. Make sure you get a pro who can speak good English though - every time my guide said "paddle" it sounded like "abort" .

This beach might not be as nice as it was told before, however it still had its charm.

Kuta beach is busy. The waves are large enough for beginners who are learning to surf. There's a long boardwalk with venders stationed all the way through out. Very few free public washrooms. Venders are selling clothes, water,beer,soft drinks and of course...massages! If you like peace and quiet...this is not the place for you. You will be constantly hounded by venders both on the boardwalk and on the beach. No escape. No end to it. As well, the beach shore is dirty. Plastic bags, cans, chip bags etc, I didn't go in to swim. By North American standards....this is a no go to me. We rented 2 beach chairs from a vender...but we were constantly interrupted by other venders to buy this and buy that...absolutely no peace. In retrospect one should probably go to the Gili islands to get a more peaceful and clean Bali beach experience. Too busy in Kuta. Too bad for Bali. The people who gave great reviews of this beach probably don't know any better.

A shame, really. Kuta today is crowded with sunburned tourists. Traffic jams are common as are plastic trash in the water and on the beach. There is little in the way of Balinese culture to be seen. Instead you'll find and hawkers standing on the streets incessantly offering "ladies", drugs, transport, and motos for rent. You can find cheap clothing, cheap beer, and bad food. There are exceptions of course and finding them makes it interesting. The water is actually brown sometimes with a frothy brown surf where the sewage dumps into the beach area. Walking north from Kuta, Legian beach is better, but not by much. Seminyak is next and a little better still. Best bet is to head to other parts of the island all together. Or Lombok, or Flores.

We love Kuta beech, enjoy the water & relaxing on the beech. Our last trip was in April 2017 & there was a great deal of plastic bags, cups & general rubbish floating in the water. This made it unbearable to swim in. It did clear up after a few days, but was certainly an issue for the first few days of our trip. Let's keep the rubbish out of the drains & waterways to prevent this from happening. Its not a nice experience to swim through all this rubbish...

To be quite honest, I expected a little more from Kuta beach, but as stated in the title I'll blame rain season. The water was extremely choppy, which was great for people who were surfing but there were so many surfers there wasn't much space for the actual swimming. There are a lot of vendors selling various items as well as women offering you, and then pestering you to get a message. Just hold your ground and when in doubt lie and say you'll come back tomorrow. The preview of the massage I received was nothing like the one I received from my hotel so beware. But one thing you will definitely want to see, and people bussed in to see it, is the absolutely gorgeous sunset, which I've attached a picture for you all to enjoy.

All of human life is here. People are doing everything, from earning a living to splashing in the surf. Superb spot for surfing, good for crashing around in the waves, but it's pretty strong so keep an eye on the little ones. Best thing to do here is to grab a Bintang and watch the beautiful sunset. There are touts, but they're only out to earn a living and will take no for an answer.

We were pleasantly surprised! Nice long beach. The locals are a bit overwhelming - everybody just trying to sell something from beers, braids, temporary tattoos, massages, armbands etc. Perfect place to watch the sunset. A local selling beer approached us, so we bought 2 beers at Rp 25,000 each and ice cold (much cheaper than a restaurant) he provided us with chairs and we watched the sunset. It was a magical moment, so romantic actually - much better than sitting in a restaurant. We went back the following night.

Everything are available in the beach.

Airport run line is located on this beach and you can see the planes keep on landing and fleeing away from the airport. Planes look like a birds flying over the beach.

All kinds of water Sports activities are available in this scenic beach.

Bargain for the prices. They usually offer a huge rate for foreigners.

You can get all the sports activities together for 7 to 8lakhs Indonesian rupees if you are in a group. So negotiate if u need the best price.
It's a wonderful beach.

Absolutely beautiful sunset!!!
Long Beautiful morning walks !!!
Local food super cheap along the wall!
U can ALWAYs lower the price of sun beds , bracelets, surf lesions , coconut water , ext.
The older locals r very friendly , (even though u feel swarmed when u first arrive with them wanting to make a sale.) the younger ones r (very aggressive on entering the beach) don't get me wrong , they r "nice" ppl but don't ever leave ur personal things with most of them. Business here in Kuta is getting slower so "times r getting harder for them" pick the ppl u chose to leave ur things with very carefully!!!
I've realized allot of them could care less about "making new friends " unless they benefit from the tourist $$$.
For surfing lesions u will always get the best deals n experience by asking around for a freelance surfer.
(Usually $10 for 2 hours)
B aware of the bracelet children ... the more money tourist give them the more their parents will keep sending them back to the beach to beg for money every single day!

I do love Kuta but it is changing , hopefully the government cracks down on the safely of tourist b4 it gets too bad!

Once you decide where you want to sit. Be prepared to be inundated with ladies selling men selling kids selling everything from jewelry to watches painting cigarettes icecream makeup pedicures and massages. While you may not need any of these things and you may find them annoying. Please remember your manners. They are just trying to make a living. The beautiful sunset will be worth it.

We have been to Kuta beach during our stay in Bali. Kuta beach is a Surf beach and easily number of people can be seen surfing. It has multiple small vendors who sell beer, drinks and various things to eat. No big restaurant inside the Beach but have a main market just outside(as all beach is covered with wall). Little dirty beach as small vendors have kept chairs and rent it out to people. People eat,drink and throw beer bottles, wrappers on the beach which lead to make it dirty. Current of water is on higher side so go in to see where you see people surfing.
Overall worth visiting but need to take care of feet while walking and current of water.Take care of belongings and no tattoo pls!!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,157,40>===============  
Kuta beach is beautiful and the perfect location for watching the sunset. It is however a nightmare for hassle. People constantly asking you to buy items etc. Don't let this out you off though. Find a good seat, get yourself a Bintang and take in the beauty of the surf, the people selling their bits and bobs and watch the sun go down. I'd recommend the Steve McQueen section. They guy is great, the surf is good and it's close to the toilet which is a requirement after several Bintang.

stay alert at all times, of people stealing your stuff...harassing you and being rude or trying to rip you off....

Be firm straight away, walk closer to the water to be hassled less or save yourself the effort and go to any other beach and be guaranteed a beautiful view and even better time without the annoying Balinese rip off artists prowling this place 24/7

We love Kuta Beach for it's uniqueness and vibe. With every visit to Bali when we first get onto Kuta beach yes we get the hawkers. Day 1 we pull up a chair, the locals grab us a cold beer and we watch our kids swim whilst we get a $5 massage for 45 minutes and buy a few bracelets for $3. We have a chat, have a laugh - they are lovely people to talk to. That's it - after that we are left alone.

We usually go to Kuta Beach in the morning around 10:30am for a few hours while our teenage sons bodyboard. We hire a couple of sun beds & umbrella and relax and watch the boys and the people go by. We may get hawkers asking if we'd like fruit or ice cream and we just say no thank you and they're gone. I don't understand what the problem is.

Waves are good for surfers and bodyboarders. Body Board hire $5 all day and one of my sons forgot his rash vest so they lent him one. $5 per sun bed for us for 3 hours. You can also get an ice cold beer $2 or a $2 warung meal. Great day out!!

Yes there are better beaches, cleaner beaches - we live in Australia so we know beautiful beaches but this is Kuta. I don't feel it's that crowded (now Bondi Beach in Australia is what I call crowded) and I don't feel inclined to swim at Kuta but the kids love the beach, they love body boarding, we love the local people and any Beach you can sit on a chair and have cold beers brought to you while you watch the sunset is a great Beach.

Very wide beach, sand wasn't as white as I expected but nice to lounge and watch the sunset.Surf, sun and five kilometers of gorgeous white sand await you on Kuta Beach in Bali, Indonesia. Learn to surf at one of the easy to find surfing schools during the day before heading out to explore the wild Kuta nightlife. Ready to relax and pamper yourself on this vacation? Spend the morning perusing hundreds of exotic shops along Kuta Beach's side streets, treat yourself to a massage at a local spa and spend the afternoon soaking up the sun at the water's edge. With restaurant and lodging options that range from five star to budget within blocks of the shore, Kuta Beach is the perfect fit for everyone from serious surfers to backpackers to those looking for a luxurious vacation destination.

I had previously visited Kuta beach a number of times over the years with the last time being some 12 years ago and though even then it was never the cleanest beach it was depressing to see what an absolute cesspool it has now become. Littered with rubbish as far as the eye can see, there are literally piles of garbage and I spotted a number of syringes lying on the ground among all the other detritus. The human garbage is probably worse though. This beach is really not a nice or relaxing place to be as the rude aggressive hawkers simply will not leave you alone. Its difficult to walk more than a few metres without being accosted by some ill mannered individual(s) whos sole intention is to weasel money out of you by any means necessary. About as far removed from the vision of paradise it is toured as Kuta is now the worst kind of tourist trap.

Clean sand & Nice sea, Notice the warning flag before swimming. The yellow half red flag is fine. Surfing recommend at 10-12pm, For family & children recommend to go around 4pm when ebb tide period.

Local merchant will try to sell the rental package for seating in every 2 minute. You can ignore them to avoid the over charge price service.

What a sight seeing all the different little bars set up along the beach with their bright coloured umbrellas and small bright chairs. Quite a sight. You can learn to surf if you are unsure how. Give it a go!! Always swim between the flags for safety reasons. There are many vendors selling anything from sarongs, massages, bracelets, sunglasses. If they are bugging you just tell them to go away. They normally do. The market is just across the road as well. If you are thirsty you just buy a beer or water from a vendor then you can sit in their chair to people watch. Sometimes the sights you see area amazing. Well worth a look

Let's start with the positive. It's a great surfing beach so if you're into that you'll have a great time.
Otherwise there's little to make it an attraction. The beach is full of hawkers trying to get you to hire a sunbed or buy fruit or drink. Whilst there's opportunity to sunbathe, there's usually a procession of folk walking up the beach.
Having said that I'm not sure why. We did and ended up having to cross two outflow pipes which we reckon are rivers but you never know! The tide was coming in at the time and in the space of 30 seconds had shot up the flatter parts of the beach by a good 15 metres. Be warned!

Kuta beach in my opinion could be far better than it was. It's a long beach with some great waves for surfing. However, it's not very clean with litter everywhere.

It was a nice beach for a walk. Lots of activity with all the bean bags and the hawkers.
I enjoyed sitting on the bean bags watching the sunset. I was well looked after with the sun setting and the position of the umbrella. The edge of the beach was disappointing with the amount of debris. I'm sure they could pay someone to clean it up. I was nervous to walk along the beach without thongs on.

I first came to Kuta Beach in 2012, and was so disappointed at the state of it. There was rubbish everywhere, including in the water itself, and there were markers of people hounding me at every exit to the beach. My return in 2017 was even worse!

There was even more rubbish this time, stretching as far as the you could see. It seemed that some people had tried to clean up, but instead of putting the rubbish in the bin, they were piled up on lots halfway on the beach. Such a shame to see someone with such beauty be destroyed by humans in such a way :(

If you're after a beautiful clean beach, you're better of heading to Ubud or Seminyak, away from the large amounts of tourists in Kuta.

It just a normal beach that can not compare to other beaches in Asia. The sand not white and the water not clear.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,164,30>===============  
As said in the title, the only good reason to be in Kuta Beach is to watch the sunset, since the place is extremely touristic. You will be assaulted by sellers of any kind, so don't think you'll be able to relax .The sand and the water are very very very dirty, so don't expect to enjoy a beach day in the traditional sense. Nice to go if you are in Kuta, not a place to head to if you are short of time. Nice for watching surfers.

Beach was quiet but quite dirty. It was strewn with the debris of the offerings given to probably the sea God earlier.Flowers, food items, various small denomination coins,baskets made of bamboo strips/palm fronds and even a half dead chicken were all thrown out on the beach by the receding tide. Though the breeze was strong, kites were flying and some people were even trying to swim. Beach can pro.bably be maintained in a cleaner manner

Pretty dirty beach that remains overcrowded. Plenty of rubbish strewn around the beach. The water didn't look that inviting either.

The beach is a tourist trap. Totally an area to just drop by to look around but not really spend too much time there. If you were looking to get a tan, you could probably pay for a reclining chair and enjoy the sun, but otherwise wouldn't recommend spending too much time there.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,164,30>===============  
This beach is like most commercial area beaches with lot of small waves also as the airport is close by you will be seeing a lot of planes landing, also a good place to learn some basics of surfing as you find instructors & board for hire.

This beach is heaven for surfers.. grab a coconut and sit on the beach at the sunset and feel heavenly.. not very clear water.. but one can enjoy with family on this beach..

I am pretty sure that there are a lot more beaches that are better than Kuta Beach. It is basically over-populated with people. There are also too many people trying to sell you things while you're just sitting there enjoy the view and breeze.

There are seats on the beach but you have to buy a drink to sit on these seats. There are also people selling handmade bracelets and doing braids. They will just randomly come to you every 5 minutes, which can be a little annoying. So will not recommend this beach to anyone. There are so many other beaches in Bali, so just go google them.

Spend a couple of days sitting under the trees at Kuta Beach and relaxing, watching the world go by. The beach is reasonably clean and the views are nice.The hawkers are not too bad once they know you're not interested and there are plenty of vendors to sell you drinks, either alcoholic or non alcoholic, when you get thirsty.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,165,30>===============  
Each team we visit Bali, Kuta beach is the same. We stay opposite the beach so it's not far to walk at all. You can have drinks on the beach. Also various people selling products or services like make up, hair braiding.

Beach is full of litter. Very Hot during the month I visited in April. Couldn't find a place to sit in the shade without people bombarding me with garbage they want to sell. Only plus was to see a nice sunset for once.

You can not walk in peace on the shoreline. Every minute another seller approaches with either surf board, sunbed, umbrella or beer offerings. Sometimes they stick to you and walk with you as well even if you insistently say you dont need anything.

My family and I spent many a day just sitting on the beach drinking a Bintangor or two,having a pedicure ,a manicure,a massage or having your hair braded or for the men there garden cared for and doing some of your gift shopping buying sarongs,shorts,tshirt sunglass and much much more all while you are just sitting in one spot.Once you have bought a few things the hawkers tend to leave you alone.Ipaid about $5 AUS for my massage and $6 to$7 for my sarongs.

The beach is just few km to ngurah rai international airport.

Situated in heart of kuta. Next to hard rock cafes and many happening places.

Good place for the surfing. High waves. You can rent surf board for less than idr 100k.

Good place for night beach walk.

Overall was good.

A very popular beach and a must see area but one to avoid if you are with a family or are looking for a relaxing experience. We were there for about an hour and a half for our daughters (9 and 11) to have a surf lesson. At the beginning we were continuously hassled to buy things, have a massage, henna tattoo, hair braiding, you name it!!! Very annoying!!

The surf lesson was enjoyable for the children but there was rubbish all around you in the sea.

There are much better beaches to go to in this area.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,166,20>===============  
Dirty and full of street sellers. Get hassled constantly. Seems good for surfers as there are very good looking waves but the beach itself really is run down and rubbish everywhere
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,166,30>===============  
We came to view and found that vendors were so pushy and just kept trying to sell their wares. We ended up leaving after 20 mins as everybody were just hitting on us the whole time. Do you want this or that or what ever. Sometimes you just want a bit of time but these people don't know the meaning of no.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,166,20>===============  
This could be a Really nice beach but there is so much rubbish lying around it spoils it. If they provided bins and made all the beach sellers clear their little patch each night it would be clean. There are so many people and so many stalls this would be easy. If you want a clean beach go North to Lovina or somewhere like that.

Dirty, stay in seminyak or legian instead. it's beautiful there. I had to get a cab to seminyak for a beach day which was annoying because i had accommodation right on kutas dirty beach. It would be beautiful without the rubbish

This review is for the beach in front of Beachwalk Mall where we went for a movie (great movie theatre!). Despite signs to respect the beach and not to litter, this beach was disgusting. Litter was every where, on and in the sand. Not a place I would swim or hang out but there were plenty of people doing just that.

This beach deserves regular cleaning and perhaps a fine program for littering because it would be beautiful - it's long and would be great for walks, swimming and everything else you do on a beach.

Great Beaches and friendly people. You will meet new people and make many lifeline friends. Though, be careful at night in certain areas.

It is just another beach in Bali for the Surf Addicts and thats all. One can enjoy the sunset, have some cheap Bintang Beer and relax!!

Found it very dirty to enter and play with the water though. Even the beach is quite dirty with filth and rubbish all around, one of the few unkempt places unlike rest of the places in Bali, which are quite cleaner.

But it is the most frequented beach for Surfers who would love to latch on to the high waves and enjoy the ride.

There is more than enough place for parking the two wheelers on the beach. Remember to lock the scooter and remember the location and ur vehicle Registration Number to identify later!

My expectations was a clean beach. Smooth sand. At least swim able waters.

Actual: too much locals screaming at you, asking if you want to rent, chairs/surfboards/mat etc. Surfers everywhere so it's difficult to swim. Dirty, rubbing everywhere. So many locals around Trying to make money but don't give a crap about cleaning the beach up. Sadly, I can have this kind of beach back home but less disturbance.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,167,50>===============  
Once you get down to where the water comes to the shore, the hagglers and sellers tend to leave you alone.. a simple no thanks will generally get them moving on.as of early April, cleaner than I had thought. You have the usual sea shells and the chip wrappers and other rubbish to step over or around. Still a great beach for a surf, swim and to people watch of course then there is the sunset!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,167,10>===============  
Just yuk
Nothing else to say but yuk!

Rubbish, dirty nappies, clothes and food left behind.

Tried doing daily runs down the beach but it was horrible.

For the beautiful Balinese people tourists should show more respect and love for the ocean and beach.
Bag your rubbish and take it with you!

I had a wonderful stroll on Kuta beach only ruined by the countless amount of rubbish .... They say it's to do with low tide and it gets cleared off after April but it was sad to witness this ... As it's a wife and beautiful beach normally....
So many people, locals and tourists alike all enjoying the amazing sunset views , enjoying a beer or two , families with kids playing with the sand , youngsters and their endless selfies ....
Lots of stalls , bars selling coconuts, drinks.... They offer a mini table and stools too ... Or you just sit on the beach but the sand gets everywhere , not recommended....
If it wasn't for the millions of rubbish that got caught on my feet I'd have rated this beach a five star .... So much going on but also so dirty ....
Try the nearby Seminyak beach, for a nicer stroll ....
Happy holidays...

Kuta beach seems to be more about parties than the actual beach, there are many shopping stores and restaurants, however the amount of trash at the beach is disgusting. Bali has several other spots much better to chill/visit/surf, Kuta is not that big deal and can easily be taken out of the itinerary.

Kuta was our 3rd destination in Bali and was chosen mostly as a famous surfing spot. Especially for the beginners

Yes, indeed.
Kuta Beach has a small "white waves", so you can stand up and feel the moves, feel how the waves are.

The bottom is sand. Just sand. What was very important to me.
The water is warm (that was in March), so you won't need a suit.

There are, may be, around 15 places offer you a surf lessons and surf boards just for rent. The board for an hour will cost you around 50000 rupiah. Lesson is different. We've got an offer 350 000 rupiah for two hours lesson.

The only one thing which is a little bit upsetting is a garbage. All over the water and all over the beach area and nobody cleans that.
So, sometimes you're actually swimming and surfing in a "garbage pool".

Overall is just great for the beginners.

We went down hired our chairs just in front of a cafe now this was great I ordered a coffee and it was delivered whilst I sat under my umbrella... yes I hear what your saying!!! Not in a take away cup ... more like a movie star getting a special treat!!
The tide was in and getting closer we couldn't sit and bake for long as the water was coming in closer it was 12.00 pm and we had to leave... the foot massage lady said due to a lot of rain.

My husband loves to feel the breezes of Seaview. The kuta beach is very near to the hard Rock hotel. Indeed it is a beautiful beach to relax. Every where we can see people lying down enjoying sun bathing under the hot sun and surfing in the sea. Except we can't totally relax well for every minutes there are merchandise promoting their products and services. They always mark up their prices and if you reject, the prices will drop to 50% of it. The choice is up to you if you are willing to pay for their services.

This beach, like Pandawa, was crowded. Not very well kept and unclean.
Access to the beach, from the road, is via steps, hence difficult for Disabled people like me to enter.

Things were a bit expensive on the beach, in terms of food.
A Good beach, to just chill out and watch people.

A nice, mostly clean, beach. There will be touts trying to sell you things constantly. If you buy a drink by the entrance, they will give you a chair to put your stuff on, and, more importantly, a place in the shade. I did this at sunset and got a beer, chair, and footstool, and the guys yelled at anyone that stood in front of me to get their photos...so an unobstructed view was part of the deal as well!

Called into Kuta for a trip as partner a cruise. We only had a day here so we can't make too big a judgement but from what we did see it's a bit of a dive.

We are kind of hotel snobs so we appreciate the finer things in life. I sure the young travellers would enjoy a cheap holiday here but it wasn't for us. Super busy, the shopping district was kind of dirty & run down & "Kuta Beach* was nothing to rave about.

We enjoyed the experience but wouldn't go back.

I do not know what a big fuss about Bali. Bali is beautiful? not really compared to other famous beaches on earth. The people are friendly? I've heard my friends are getting yelled and got a rude treatment from Balinese. Also the culture and dances are not special. In fact, Bali is true tourist spot for someone who is broke. I mean a cheap vacation if you want to see the monkeys and so so views.

Look I love Bali and first visited this wonderful place in 1976 and been back over 40 times since then,surfing and enjoying this beautiful place. I have seen so many changes over the years both good and bad but nothing could prepare me for the disgusting state of Kuta and Legian beaches. The plastic and rubbish has to be seen to be believed. Kilometers of garbage carried to Bali on the waves and wind from Java. It's an environmental disaster and if Bali is to survive the problem needs immediate attention. The ocean was so polluted in December that surfers had to stay out of the water and what about the damage to the marine environment? The fishermen set their nets and just get plastic bags it's a disgrace and the government needs to act now.

This is a long, wide beach at low tide. The lower part next to the sea is easy to walk along, whilst the back beach is loose sand. The beach is accessed at numerous points from the road. The top of the beach next to the road is well vegetated and shady, and there are numerous stall holders offering drinks, seats, some loungers, and other goods including surf board hire and lessons. Stall holders can be quite persistent in securing business. The area is popular for surfers, although there were not many rollers evident when we were there. The sea is warm, so pleasant for swimming. We were surprised at the level of litter on the beach. This was extensive and very unsightly, possibly the result of flotsam at high tide. Some attempt had been made at clearing areas, but this seemed superficial. In one area a number of sun loungers were completely immersed in debris. This is a shame, as the beach has potential to be very attractive.

Kuta Beach is really just suitable as a walk rather than swimming situation. There is plenty of litter & tides occasionally are hazardous. If you like beach swimming then you'd be better off outside Kuta central.

I'm not sure about why did some people find the beach dirty but when i was there, it was a perfect sandy white beach. It is also the best place so try surfing. Rates for surfboards with instructor i got was for 180,000 Rupiah. Pretty reasonable.

One thing i didn't like was people kept trying to sell you miscellaneous items such as towels, key chains and other unnecessary items. Just kindly decline and they would be gone.

Also the sunset was amazing. Hues of pink and orange filled the skies and was honestly one of the best sunset I've ever seen

I don't know why people even bother coming to Kuta beach, except for the surf waves. There are two huge negatives here: (1) Relentless and constant vendors, hounding you to buy trinkets and snacks and hats and whatever, (2) Trash. This is one of the worst beaches we've seen on Bali for trash. You cannot wade knee deep without getting several pieces of plastic garbage wrapped around your legs. Horrifying.

Visiting the beach was great, reminded me of the beaches at home only bigger. my only suggestion is dont sit there for long. the people come in waves one after the other sometimes 2 or 3 at a time forcing you to buy things. a lady refused to let me take off the anklet from my foot that i did not want in the first place and told me i had to pay later or she will rock up to my hotel room. i was not impressed, another lady kept coming back to rub my feet and shoulders telling me my feet were ugly and laid her tools and ointments out on my sun bed. they do not take no for an answer and you cannot get away without being rude. the beers and watching the surfers were good however 8 people told us not to enter the water or we will definitely get sick!

Kuta beach is one of the best beach in bali, with good sunrise view and midle wave for surfing offcourse this beach be one of the favourit tourist destination, white sand a lot of bar for rileks and enjoy the beach situation.

The currents and waves are very strong here. If people aren't in the water. Don't go in the water. Kuta is an awesome beach to walk and stroll through. It was clean and perfect to pull up a chair, watch the sunset and people watch. Had a great time on Kuta. Early morning there are groups of people who walk through and pick up trash. Great place to hang out and chill.

The sunset is absolutely stunning, unfortunately just about the whole world knows about it. It has become very commercial, there are rows of chairs set out with beer crates as tables, loads of pop up bars serving beer which is very nice. The nick back sellers are a bit of a nuisance and tend to pester. The only place to get a good photo is the waters edge, even then you have catch a shot between all the people in the water

If you're looking for the beautiful sunset, kuta is the right place. You can enjoying the beautiful sunset, and you can bring your kids to play the sands... but I think kuta is not too clean place.

Didn't hang around to bathe or chill but rather used it to take a surf lesson. Waves were great for that.
Too many hawkers on the beach to have a relaxing time. There are so many better options than this one for anything else but surfing.

For 5 couples spending 3 nights at Kuta beach's Best Western Hotel, the location is centrally located and well accessible. The beach road was closed for vehicles for new year's and the beach was thronged by crowds - locals n tourists alike for celebrations with fireworks n a large beach party. There were huge crowds near the pubs on the beach road as well. Recommended place.

The beach is presently dirty. Thre is anything from bits of plastic, shoes and huge pieces of wood in the waves. What a shame the Government cannot pay low income people to clean the beach daily, or the kids be taught at school about pollution. Apart from that, the beach is friendly and the water temperature perfect!
Have spent the last few days being spoiled at Hans and Tonys Bar- sitting in shade on the beach and friendly banter from Hans who answered all our questions on Bali. No fuss or pushiness.
The hawkers are numerous and really intrusive- placing bracelets you dont want or starting to massage you without permission. We try to be respectful but really getting sick of saying no thank you repeatedly to the same person before they move on. Some people want to try out their English and we know that these people are just trying to eke out a living, but six or more people about you asking you to buy from them is neither enjoyable or necessary.
You can buy icecreams, international newspapers, bow and arrows, sunglasses, jewellery, kites, clothing, carvings, painyings, etc, etc on the beach and be prepared to haggle hugely.
And, if you are lucky enough to meet up with Hans, please give him our tegards from Jenny and Col.

Kuta beaches are different because of the the dark grey sand. Surfing is good at certain times but it's not ideal for swimming.

Both the water and the sand are very dirty. The place is very crowded and there were probably more vendors than tourists. Unless you are a surfing enthusiast, don't keep your expectations too high. It would probably be wiser not to go there after visiting the real beauties of Bali!

Stayed a couple of days walked along the beach multiple times... (3km)
Its dirty... to the extreme... all over.
Every 5m you get harassed: "Hey!!! Broooo!!!" ; "You go Surfing"

They are not friendly.

Kuta is the place to be in Bali! From a beer on the beach to shopping in the malls it has it all. Traffic can be very busy at times. Lots of places to eat, drink and stay. Love Kuta, a must for any first time Bali traveller.

I live by the Beach in England, so im no stranger to the see.

This beach is great nice and sandy.
I titile this beach as scary because im a relatively tall guy (5ft11") and an avid swimmer but the beach or shall I say see was at most the times up to my waist. Theres no drop for ages so I may have walked out 50metres an it would still be up to my waist.

Heres the scary the waves were HUGE. Even when i walked out 20 meters the waves could cover me. And the undercurrent is strong as well.
On a calm day to.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND KIDS BEING IN THIS RUFF SEA.

1thing to put you at ease is the Lifeguards are on it. They see everything. They were beyond good. And it wernt like i was being stupid but I did see people being stupid not respecting this turbulent see but it wouldnt last long at all cz the lifeguards were so good.
Great place to surf tho.

Me I enjoyed the beach and the see but its not for non strong swimmers. Keep that in mind but other than that very good place.

Literally the worst beach I've ever been to. Avoid at all costs.

The beach itself was so dirty you could hardly walk without hurting your feet on plastic, or glass bottles. There was rubbish everywhere.

Each entrance to the beach is surrounded with locals trying to sell something to you - taxis, food drink. The problem is they don't leave you alone. You say 'no' politely, and they proceed to follow you down the beach shouting at you and they even grabbed my friend's arm. Not acceptable.

In the end we were on the beach for no more than 10 minutes and left - we left Kuta that day.

Much nicer beaches in Sanur and in the Gilis. Go there instead!

It was our first trip to Bali and we had seen lots of pictures of Kuta beach online but seemed to be a regular beach. Lots of sea waste being washed out on the beach leaving very little space for you to enjoy the beach. It's best to go there during high tide as most of the sand part is covered in water and best time for surfing
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,176,20>===============  
you can access the beach easily from the nearby hotel or beach walk mall , the place is quite crowded, full of people start from foreigners, and local who sells stuffs like bangle, necklace or temporary tattoo , you can also rent surfing board here.
you can find food easily nearby too ( western, Chinese or even local food)
the thing that makes me uncomfortable is you can see a lot of trash along the beach. this beach has a serious cleanness issue. need help not from cleaning teams only but also from people who visit the beach.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,176,50>===============  
Despite reading bad reviews about it...we found it very clean and the atmosphere was just amazing. Around the sunset time it was really packed but i could understand it. The sunset was breathtaking. There were lifeguards all day long so you could feel safe.

If you are willing to lay down in a confy seat by the sea, drink something and enjoy the day, that's the place around.
Different from the other beaches in Bali here you have not only structure to pass the day but also it's a sand beach so you can actually walk or enter the sea without fear of hurting your feet in rocks or corals.
There is a big street with many stores and restaurants
They offer surf classes as well
The only problem is that there are MANY people trying to sell things (and they don't go away even if you say "no" a hundred times), so if you want to rest and sleep try a different beach, you will be awake by sellers
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,177,50>===============  
Great breach with a good surf and sunset/sunrise, get harassed a little from vendors who are trying to sell wristbands, fake watches, art work to street food but a polite 'no thank you' and they leave you alone. Beach vendors bring you beers when needed and a nice tip wouldn't go a miss to the locals. Plenty of scooter parking along the beach, beach extends to Seminyak.

From a distance the beach and the blue Indian ocean with white surfing waves looks beautiful. But despite the efforts of cleaning teams employed by the authorities the beach and shoreline are badly littered. Indeed the water itself is full of detritus. Mostly plastic. This does not deter the very many surfers. There are many hawkers selling anything and everything. Undoubtedly the best thing is the sunset

We come to Kuta every year so know all about its reputation. I suppose it is all about expectations, although this is not our kind of place, we always have a wonderful time.

The beach is really good. They do their best to keep it as clean as possible and, for the most part, succeed. The wall that separates it from the road is amazing and unlike anything you see in any other country.

You can enjoy a stroll along, something more strenuous like a fast walk or just relax at one of the many sunbeds available for hire. There are places to get food and drink and there is always something to say.

Saving the best till last, The sunset is fabulous. Get down there about 6:15 PM and enjoy a cold beer for just over a pound whilst taking in the amazing views.

Kuta beach is the most crowded tourist destination in Indonesia particularly Bali. The beach is beautiful during sunset with thousands of beach seekers from any part of the world. In the night on this beach is not as safe as you think about, better you are not going out to the beach in the noght. A police was attacked by tourists a few years ago in the night on the beach in the night. But now the condition of the beach security is getting better.

Great beach, we have just been and they are currently doing the beach clean up but this didn't affect us at all. My boyfriend did an hours surf lesson for 200,000 and i had an umbrella 50,000 for the hour. You get harassed by locals for massages etc but you get used to it, just say no thank you and they will leave you alone.

I have mixed reviews about Bali as a first timer! expecting the gorgeous clean clear blue water! i was hit with more of a dirty green water and trash all along the cost. This made it unappealing and the least desire to take a dip in the water! nonetheless it is one of Bali's east side known beach with several resorts and bar along the coast.

Not sure if i would recommend anyone this beach for swimming but for other activities i would, restaurants, bars and nightlife

We were there in the evening just before the sunset. It's really a nice beach with very fine sand. The sound of the wave was great. People were surfing, swimming and it's very clean.

Full of rubbish, dirt and plastic debris.
To be just honest.. it just stinks!
Tourist mongering hustle like anywhere between Seminyak and the Airport.
Bad coffee on any shops for $4 next to a sewage stinking creek. Na thanks.
Have a bath in the murky waters and run to the next Apotek for Prednisone and Aciclovyr creme.. you sure need it.

Or get a plastic chair to sit on offered by Javanese with a large esky for a bottle with a exorbitant inflated price.

Kuta beach is the main tourist destination beach on Bali. It is surrounded by hotels, eating places, coffee shops, markets of all kinds. It is a long flat beach with lot's of vendors who will give you a massage, or sell you drinks or nibbles. It has a patrolled life guard swimming area, unless you are a very strong swimmer always swim between the yellow flags where you have the best chance of rescue if you get into trouble. But this is generally a very safe beach, quite clean but definitely not quiet. There is a huge tidal swell and at sunset the tide goers out perhaps about 100 meters and it is a favourite place to take sunset pix. Highly recommended for a visit.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,179,40>===============  
What else to say? This is the most famous beach in Bali.
Not visiting this place is like you visiting a gas station but not buying any gas. :D

We love visiting Kuta beach everytime we travel to Bali, watching the locals teach the tourists how to surf is always entertaining.

It is good for young people for getting wasted. Also good for beginner surf lessons, but be prepared to get ripped off. Otherwise the local selling culture is super annoying, it's dirty and don't feel safe at all. This is the place you go and see once and you never want to go back again

The beach is beautiful and the water is great.

If you want to surf the kuta beach is the best place to learn. You will find many surfers on the beach. I would pay extra and go with rip curl.

There are so many surfers that harass you on the beach that you get annoyed and want to leave. It is a shame because it is a nice place to be. There are no chairs or place to put ur stuff.

I would go to a beach club, worth money ur spent for your peace of mind.

The beach clubs are great in the south of Bali; seminayak or Jimbaran bay.

Kuta beach is a busy spot for especially young tourists: weather is often nice, cheap places to eat and a lot of pubs, bars and clubs.

Because of its popularity, there are also some downsides to that place: taxi-drivers can be aggresive, a lot of trafficjams, pickpockets are active night and day and a lot of salesmen on the streets.

However, if you can live with these downsides, you could have a really good time in Kuta beach.

Tip: don't go to Kuta for the beach or surfing. Garbage is everywhere: on the beach and in the sea. (Surfing between the dirt)

There's not much to say about the beach it's central so very touristy with a lot of people trying to sell you things. Great for sunset pictures but maybe not for tranquil relaxation. I didn't walk the length of the beach so there maybe quieter places to set up for a long day

Beautiful view watching the sunset in the evening while walking on the beach. It's a wonderful place to be in the evening and their are quite a few good restaurants there and evening music and small stores with local goods and souvenirs to buy. The beach is behind the the centro mall and the mall is good for tourist buyers to take gifts and souvenirs for family and friends.

This beach, many years ago it was a beautiful beach with white sand. The sand these days is far from white and from jalan 66 Northwards there is a few creeks coming out on the beach and they do really STINK and a few weeks ago one of them was covered with an oil film and it was clearly diesel fuel.
These days Kuta beach is from about November till March covered in Natural and plastic debris. The authorities do try to clean it up but it is an impossible task. The Natural debris must have been there for centuries during that time of the year but the plastic is getting worse every year. I used to swim on this beach but these days I don't think the water would pass a health check. If you really want to swim then make sure you have a good shower afterwards, even during the other months of the year. Please don't stop coming to Bali because the local people have to make a living and that is mainly from the tourists who visit the "Island of the Gods"

Despite problems at times with rubbish a visit to this beach is a must.
On our visit nice and clean with great surf.
Just to sit on the beach at one of the small bars and have a drink and watch the passings by is fascinating
OK you put up with the hawkers but that all part of the game.
Watch the sun go down and you wonder at this great beach.
A must visit in Bali

Thankfully we didn't stay in Kuta but in Nusa Dua; however, we did visit Kuta and thought it was not great. It is packed and somewhat dirty, filled with people trying to sell you stuff and the area is just not relaxing. It's good if you just want to come here to bargain with people over stuff that's overpriced (buy elsewhere) to just get that experience and see the Kuta Beach gates, but that's it. Do not come or stay here if you're wanting to play in the water or have a relaxing day.

The sea and waves are great, but the amount of garbage cast on to the shore twice a day by tides is enourmous!!!

Although in some places locals quickly rake it up, it can be equally a 50 meters away like a landfill. And some people even manage to set this garbage on fire.
Tons on plastic bags and bottles , stray dogs eating soked nappies and... western tourists doing their morning jog with their iPhones and last diving classes for tourists being filmed by DJI Phantom drones flying over the waves.
What a contrast.

Our group of two families decided to take the kids for a swim at Double 6 Beach, totally different to what we are used to on the Gold Coast where we live. But definitely worth checking out. If you sit on a beanbag bag and buy a drink your allowed to stay there. We waited for the sun set and the band. Would be good to sit and relax and enjoy the music without the kids

Just remember the beach has a lot of rubbish on the sand and water, but don't let that spoil your holiday!

Well, this beach is very conveniently located but, very crowded and littered. That's of course given considering the foot fall. Just outside the beach there any many places to hang out. Like other beaches the shops and kiosks are plenty. Did not venture out for any water sport though..

Absolute waste of coast. This beach is littered with rubbish and debris. It's that dirty black sand that stains everything. The entire beach is lined with sunbeds for hire at around 2.5 to 5 Aud hour. The hawkers make sitting in these unbearable as you can't relax for all the people offering massages, pedicures and sunglasses. Across the road is filled with western shopping centers and fast food joints. There is nothing pleasant or cultural about Kuta. It's a wasteland ruined by excessive amounts of Australian tourists. Sorry guys! Do your self a favour and skip it all together.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,183,30>===============  
The beach itself is beautiful and the surfing is perfect for beginners. The number of places to rent surf boards means that you can always haggle and it's cheap to get a board and a sun bed for the day.

In rainy season the rubbish in the ocean is washed up onto shore but the locals do clean it up and it's usually a bit better after the early morning. The only issue is with hawkers and it makes it truly insufferable.

If you spend the full day at the beach you can expect to have to turn away people over 50 times - without exaggeration. At one point in the day we had a queue waiting to each ask us if we wanted a massage or hair braiding one after the other and it was infuriating. They will even wake you up to ask you.

Some may not mind this but I don't think I would go back again. If the local elders ever sort this problem then it would be a nice beach - but will always be very very busy.

Went on a Sunday so it was relatively quiet. If you walk along the top of the beach there are many stalls to buy towels, shoes, bracelets, massages, hair braids etc. In the middle of the beach you can hire lounge chairs and buy drinks, or get surf lessons. We walked along the water of the beach and didn't get humbugged by the locals trying to sell us a lot. Water was lovely and cool. The beach walk can be very long so wear sunscreen and drink water.

As Kuta is the most touristic part of Bali, we stayed over there, then when walking on the beach we saw it's a surfer beach! You can take a 1 hour lesson or rent a surfboard, because it was my first time i took a class and it was worthy (Cost around 20 USD) they give you some theory and maybe you end standing up in the waves. There's a lot of people in there trying to sell things and you have to choose from which guy you take the class, also the best time to go is at 9-10am and try to avoid after 3pm.

While in Bali we decided we had to visit the busy Kuta Beach ! We were quite shocked to see so many piles of trash / plastic bottles ...everywhere ! What a shame...for such a popular tourist site ! The beach sand is darker than most Caribbean beaches but soft enough. The vendors are plentiful and persistent. Plastic chairs are available to sit on IF you buy drinks from the "owners ".Beer is expensive compared to other locales . This could and should be a beautiful beach but KUTA needs to " clean up its act ".
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,183,40>===============  
I'm a little confused by some of the comments here especially considering this is a huge tourist spot....what are you coming to Bali for then ?
Pop down to Kuta Beach later into the afternoon to best take advantage of everything it has too offer.
Pull up a chair at one of the many beach bars where you will meet many of the friendly locals who'll more than happy to offer you a icy cold beverage.
Yes there are many vendors that will try and sell you their wares but it's just a simple "no thank you" and they will leave you alone.
Yes the beach is not the cleanest but as a tourist we do contribute to the waste ourselves by our purchases.
But Kuta beach is best viewed watching the sunset go down whilst watching the planes fly in and as the local fly kites as you have the tough decision of where to go for dinner.
...lighten up and get down here !

I visited the beach area a couple of times in February. During our stay there was heavy wind and red flags by the beach indicating that swimming was forbidden. The waves were impressive.

Kuta Beach is one of the better known beaches in Bali. I was excited to see it and take some pictures of it at sunset.

Unfortunately, it is the dirtiest beach I have ever been to. There is so much rubbish on the beach and I the water that it immediately discourages any motion to sit down and take in the view.

Tuban and Legian beaches are nearby and in better shape than Kuta.

With my first visit here, I was disappointed with all the plastic in the water. With every stroke through the water you were guaranteed to hit some form of plastic.

Beach was terrible at that time of year, so sad to see. Walked from Kuta to Seminyak and I have never seen the beach looking so ugly in the 25 years we have been going, rubbish everywhere and piles and piles of washed up timber, water running from the land look filthy. The beach above the waterline was clean , more so if it was in front of a hotel. Hopefully next time it will be better, combination of weather, excessive rubbish washed from inland and washed down from Java was the answer given by the locals.

This is a really nice beach, avoid the hawkers, surf instructors and beach bars, just tune out and stroll from Kuta beach to Legian beach. Ocean can get a bit rough, but pick your day and all will be good. Not flash after a storm, fair bit of rubbish gets washed up, but the locals generally get it cleaned up quickly.

Kuta beach is more for surfers than anything else, as it's not really ideal for sunbathing and such - The beach isn't very wide especially at high tide, and what space there is is mostly occupied by vendors attempting to sell every kind of thing. If you like that kind of stuff, it would be good. But if you want a relaxing time, it's best to stay at your hotel pool, because the vendors will come by every two minutes to sell stuff.

Kuta used to be a beautiful beach that was probably one of Bali's richest natural resources--on our last visit over 10 years ago, it was a paradise of surf, sunsets, good beer, and friendly people.

So we came back to try to get back into surfing, slowly, on a beach break and of course to enjoy the sun, sand, and sunsets.

We were completely shocked to find that Kuta had literally turned into a garbage dump. A long time ago, sure some wood and a little bit of trash would wind up washing up--in December, there were piles of garbage everywhere being cleaned up by front end loaders and hauled away in dump trucks--did it get better--no, the garbage kept washing up for weeks. The local newspapers noted that over 200 tons had been cleaned up and that this was a record amount.

We were disappointed, because it used to be a world class beach. We had to go over to the other side of Bali, just to get in the water. We didn't even bother trying to surf Kuta because it was just filthy.

We talked to a lot of the beer sellers and chair rental people and they just told us they couldn't do anything about it and that we should come back in summer when the current washes the garbage someplace else...and the Balinese we asked about the garbage blamed the problems on Java and the folks in Java blamed it on the Balinese...

When the garbage is heaped in mounds on a beautiful beach--maybe just solve the problem--are tourists going to keep coming if its filthy? Maybe if other beaches are cleaner they'll just go there--we won't be back to Bali until the garbage problem is dealt with.

Also--the loitering pickpockets who hang around the entrances at the beach didn't really improve our mood. If you have a day pack, try to walk in couples so that there is not some guy slinking around behind you. The entrance near the McDonald's seemed to be a problem.

Basically, we felt sorry for the local folks who make a living from the beach.

We found a place to just get wet and the water was filled with plastic trash. It was disgusting to see and feel around you with every move. The prevailing winds wash stuff on shore. The shoreline is kept up as can be, the small business umbrella and chair vendors rake around their territory, but the water was unimaginable with yuk.

I kind of expected it to be honest, the last time I visited Bali 7 years ago I remember watching the sea currents washing waves of rubbish along the coast nothing has changed, I walked the length from Kuta beach to seminyak through what I can only describe as a rubbish you can't see the sand for litter and then piles of it also every 120 meters. I was considering learning to surf here but after watching the waves crash in you could actually see all the plastic In the waves there's was tons of it so I don't think it would be a pleasurable Experiance. There was a sign saying it happens from December to March but last time I visited was in April and there was no difference. I have been diving in other parts of Bali and the sea is much better, I do remember gilli T and Lombok beaches being really nice. My advise is if you have to stay in Kuta get a place with a nice pool if you fancy a dip.

Definitely depends on what time of year you come as the rubbish in the water can put you off. However there are a lot of different vendors with umbrellas and bean bags that will sell you icy cold drinks.

I would like to advice others to not put higher expectation for this beach. Few years ago it has become an icon for Kuta town but not more today. I only spent around 30 minutes here. Trash is everywhere and you can easily find dogs hanging around the beach. Definitely not a clean beach but you still can enjoy the sunsets and windy evening.

Kuta Beach, wow, I'll never forget my first glimpse of Kuta Beach. It was nearing sunset on our first day in Bali. We had only just checked into the Bali Garden Resort and were exploring the property when we walked out onto the most beautiful site, Kuta Beach at sunset. This sunset attracts sun worshippers from all over the planet. It's truly amazing. Faces turned to the sea and sky, glowing with pink and golden rays. Mother Earth in all her finery! How then, is it possible that my second view of Kuta Beach turned my stomach?
The next morning we wanted to start our day with a walk down the beach. We set out on the boardwalk and instantly we were slapped in the face by the most horrific site! Our beautiful Kuta Beach had transformed overnight into miles and miles of trash. WTF! It looked like someone had bumped truckload after truckload of garbage all along the beach. It was COVERED with garbage! My heart was broken. What happened?!
The tide! Over night the tide had washed in heaps of plastic from the sea. Unbelievable! Oh My God! I had never seen such devastation! Yet the beach was very busy. People everywhere. Armies of locals with rakes, shovels, brooms, bags and trucks, trying to clean the beach. This site too was amazing. Everyone working together to remove the plastic plague of Kuta Beach.
Every day the beach is cleaned by the people who make their living there. Every day the sea washes in more and more and more plastic. Wow! What a cycle. Once most (most is the best you could hope for because every wave brings more) of the garbage is gone life on beautiful Kuta Beach begins. Surfing lessons, sun bathing, cold Bintang and the most wonderful local people make the beach come to life. The beach's beauty is restored (mostly) and life is good! What a wonderful way to spend the day.
That evening as the sunset again with all the wonder and glory of the evening before I realized that you can look past the plastic plague and fall in love with Kuta Beach.

Note: thank you for reading this far. If you are planning to visit Bali, I ask that you be considerate of the footprint you leave behind. Take a refillable water bottle and keep it full. You'll need it! Don't use straws or disposable plastic cups. Take a reusable cloth shopping bag when you go shopping. And take the time to visit with the folks that work along the beach. They are wonderful people. The footprints you leave in the sand will be gone with the next wave, don't let it be replaced with a plastic bag. Live, love and laugh at Kuta Beach! Peace.

Although there were piles of drift wood and rubbish in 2 or 3 places, that's as far as it got. Never actually cleared while we were there. Take away the rubbish and it would be a better beach.

Had a walk along the beach but it was filled with filthy garbage. The paddlers are a bit too pushy. The water was gray and the waves are overturning brown soil, making it look like sewer water. Probably due to the weather and strong winds, but I won't be swimming here.

This beach has enough rip tides to give you goose bumps. So, grab one of those surf boards and if you have not experienced the thrill of surfing, now is the time. Other than that, there are mostly eating joints along the beach, and place to lie down for sunbathing and a refreshing beer.
The nearby market is a great place for cheap shopping and souvenirs. But, I believe, there could have been some more activities rather than just surfing.

It is known that the water along the Kuta area is not turquoise over white sand and swinging palm trees. For picture-perfect, idyllic beaches head to Thailand or Malaysia. I chose Kuta because of its proximity to the airport, not because of its beach. Not only is the water average but there are other disadvantages: In December, so they say, huge heaps of trash (organic and the other type too) get accummulated on the shore each morning. They take their time to clean. By midday you begin to see people working. Decolored beach umbrellas make the picture even more pathetic. And don't get me started with the ugly PVC beach chair, all with a pack of hawkers and an uncalled for wall as a backdrop. The hawkers would come around to offer drinks, surfing boards, chairs for rent and what have you. Horrible.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,192,10>===============  
This place is waaay to much dirty for me.
And also a big minus is all the sellers that harass you from the minute you touch the sand/beach.

Some won't even leave even if you tell them no or I'm not interested in the products they are selling etc.

Never seen so much garbage and plastic on a beach, ever. Added a picture but it's not really possible to see all the plastics etc there. Just warning you guys...

Me and my two friends walked maybe 600m on this beach and we calculated around 124-126 sellers.
Jewelry, surf school, peanuts, beer, was the most common ones

Pending what time of the year, reasonably clean and safe beach for swimming, busy with tourists , beach sellers, bars etc. Fun to visit and have a dip or catch a little wave, then chill with some beach cooked corn and cool bintang!
Most of the beaches around here have beautiful sunsets so always remember your camera.
Worth a visit, for the experience, there are a lot of beaches on Bali and each offer something different, surf, quiet, fun, and more.

Kuta beach is what originally encouraged tourism here and lead to a surf scene. Well, this has been totally spoiled. Kuta beach is now full of rubbish and annoying hawkers. If you get into the water, you are in danger of being hit by rubbish. When walking on the beach bare feet, you might step into a syringe. It is very sad but the brutal truth of our society, world and Asian rubbish disposal in particular. I can't recommend it at all. Very sad.

Frankly, you are much better off visiting Seminayak or Nusa Dua beach for beach activity. Kuta is filthy and dirty with spoils all over it. The water also doesn't look clean at all. You do not want to take a dip here.

In terms of waves, they are good and there's activity also on the beach. But it looks very bad...

was really dissapointed as a first time visitor,the beach is quite long with trees edging the path ways, locals set up their own little bar areas a couple of chairs and a table and cool box they are very friendly although you are pestered by lots of sellers from clothes jewellery,paintings even a cross bow you can get a bargain, well grab a beer sit yourself down then you can spend your time counting all the empty plastic bottles and empty bags over the beach area. wouldnt swim in the sea thats for sure
it is a shame but seems no one cares

It's a shame that one of the most well known parts of Bali has become dirty. Travelling to Bali since 1989 it is the dirtiest I've ever seen in. It's a shame it has become this way and the locals are working hard to clean it up so I hope in the future it improves. Sanur and Nusa Dua are calmer, cleaner and quieter beaches, especially for young families or children who don't necessarily like the crowds or rough surf.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,193,10>===============  
Wet season is not the best time to see this beach as the various 'creeks' or more often sewer outflows have the plastics and rubbish that has accumulated flushed out into the ocean. The place is littered with empty water bottles, plastic wrapping and other waste that has been thrown out into the street. Behind the various bars that line the foreshore is hidden the mountains of plastic and garbage that seem to be the result of tourism pressure. It is such a shame to see what could be a pleasant place to swim if it was not littered with our garbage. Just beats me how people seemed to even want to lie in the sand surrounded by plastic that gets washed up. The contaminated water that flows out has a polluted smell though with some rubbish traps could at least reduce the pollution.
Local authorities need to do something as this has been a problem for years. Have a paddle but don't risk your health by swimming in the area.

We came here for 2 nights after being in Uluwatu & Nusa Lembongan & I'm so so glad we saw beaches there before here as this place is massively disappointing. The beach is strewn with litter (as in huge piles of it!!), it is far from the white sand/blue sea of Nusa Lembongan. It is full of small local vendors selling drinks & food which is fine and well priced, just pick you spot of which you like the look of!
You get constantly hassled by people trying to sell you stuff which is something, up until this stage we hadn't seen in Bali at all. Suppose because this place is seen as the most popular tourist destination, that's why the locals flock here.
If you decide to come off the beach onto the walkway behind, again you get hassled constantly. We walked maybe 45-60mins along and towards the end you get tired of saying "no sorry" to literally every person!!
We didn't spend any time at all at the beach because of these reasons & I would not recommend Kuta to anybody other than maybe shopping! But coming from London, we have better shopping at home anyway! Such a huge disappointment for a gorgeous country.

This is the most famous of Bali's beaches. Visit it for that reason alone, and grab a cold drink while watching tourists and locals interact.

Mobile vendors will most certainly approach you with copy watches, sunglasses and sarongs. It's all good fun.

The sea was covered in plastic and all sorts of gross garbage, it wasn't enjoyable to swim in without having garbage touching you. The beach was beautiful to sit on and they sell alcohol behind you with seats and little tables which was convenient, (around 25,000 rm for a drink) but it was quite annoying having women and men coming up to you and trying to sell you random bracelets or icecream or really anything unnecessary. It was annoying because they would stand in front of your view or two women actually sat down right infront of us even after saying no a million times.

Kuta Beach is a really sad example of something once beautiful gone wrong. There is more plastic on the beach than a landfill site. It made my wife cry.
It was a very strange site to see young people taking surf training lessons on the beach with the boards on top of heaps of trash.

One hears about the beauty of Bali and it's fine beaches, but in reality, times have changed tremendously and Kuta Beach, as well as many surrounding beaches in Bali, are full of trash: plastic, cans, garbage.

The problem with Kuta beach, like all of Bali, is that you are going to be harassed by sellers, regularly. From sellers offering drinks, to massages, to fake Tatts, to fans towels and more. It's a shame really, because the beach isn't too bad, but you get sick of being approached repeatedly by different sets of hawkers.... Your hotel pool is probably a better option, or head further up the coast where the sellers aren't as frequent...

Unfortunately this beach is polluted with litter; apparently the majority of its rubbish washes up from other shores which is no fault of Kuta's.

Quite a number of vendors will try to sell you stuff so be prepared, especially if you decide to hire a deck chair and stay for a few drinks.

The culmination of Bali can be found on the walk along Kuta Beach.
The picturesque Sunset can be enjoyed by a leisurely stroll along the boardwalk or by taking a seat in prime position to view the beauty from many spots on Kuta Beach.
The people, sights & smells are Bali.
An experience you must have to complete your visit.
The stroll is flanked by many beautiful hotels offering great happy hour deals and lovely food.
I Must say, we have never had the urge to swim in the water as there seems to be a lot of debris. This is only a small detraction from its greater beauty.

I see some calling this an amazing beach. They were totally wasted (or worse), reviewed a beach while looking at pictures vs actually setting foot here or got paid.

Kuta's beach is, right behind Seminyak horrible. Dirty, filthy, yellow sand, overcrowded, low quality bars, etc. It's looks more like huge garbage bin, not a beach someone goes to enjoy.

Horror. Big contester for the worlds ugliest beach.

Kuta beach has already famous for sunset and surfing, no wonder this beach becoming one of many tourist destinations in Bali. The problem is during certain period, large amount of rubbish coming from the sea, a quick action should be taken from the local authority

Since we stayed in Sheraton Hotel ,Kuta beach is just in front of the hotel and we visited the beach daily in the morning and evening..It is,not clean due to existence of a large no of temporary snacks and drink shops. Visitors come in large no not only to loiter but also to enjoy sea breeze.Some visitors enjoy massage by professionals who have their kiosks on the beach.Due to shallow water one has to go a considerable distance to swim or bath in sea water.Evening time it is very crowded.

Of the bloody harassment of shop owners selling the same stuff and the constant pestering while trying to relax on the beach.. the aggressiveness of how a few individuals try to make a sales is straight up rude..
The beach is swamped with rubbish and clutter which takes away what could possible be a good beach..

Often one of the first places that visitors to Bali head for, Kuta might be a place you either want to stay for a long time or can't wait to get away from. There a number of reasons why tourists love it - plenty of good hotels (ranging from the economical to high end), numerous food options (again, spanning the spectrum of budgets), a vibrant shopping scene, and a fairly famous beach where surfing can be learnt, time can be whiled away, or just people watching. I have to admit I've never been much of a beach person, but I did enjoy an evening stroll along the beachside path, It was interesting to see the beachfront restaurants open for business, the local fishermen trying their luck during the last vestiges of daylight, and see other people enjoying the evening sea air. However, the same reasons flipped over might be the reason some folks won't set foot here or can't wait to leave - overwhelming crowds and overpriced food and items for sale being the most likely issues. Nevertheless, for anyone who's not yet been here, there's only one way to find out which group you belong to.

This beach is disgusting, there is rubbish absolutely everywhere, you cannot go in the sea without huge chunks of rubbish wrapping around your arms and legs and you're constantly hassled by people trying to sell you crap.

I think people only come here to surf because you cannot swim in it as of the rubbish being everywhere and the rough waves.

Also you always get guys trying to scam you for a sun bed, they will walk over and say '200,000 for the day', if you want a sun bed just say '40,000' and begin to walk off, soon enough they will accept it.

Also one more thing, you can't leave your girlfriend alone for a minute without guys trying to sing to her or chat her up, it seems that 99% of Balinese guys are desperate for white girls (they even told me this themselves) they aren't over the top with it, and they won't do it in front of you, but knowing their intentions is uncomfortable when you want to relax.

Did not swim but there are nice trees long the beach and lots of stalls offering food and various other products. Great for sunset viewing. There is a path along one side if you do not want to get into the sand.

The "legendary" beach. A stone throw away from all Kuta Hotels (hard rock, etc) and Kuta Beach Walk Malls. A 2 KM strips of sandy beach with friendly surf that benefits surfers to be. Many locals selling drinks and renting mats. With massage or bob marley hair done offers every now and then. Nice for morning jogs when a bit serene before 7. Can get scorching hot after 10 - use hat and sunscreen lotion generously. Of interest are some Puras in and around with balinese offering prayers - oblivious to the cacophony of tourism around.

Ok so if u surf then u would like this beach otherwise don't bother! It's so dirty and full of rubbish it's unbelievable, and u get your head pecked every 2 minutes by the locals trying to sell u something. If u say yes to one within 5 minutes you are surrounded! Don't bother visiting there are better beaches such as seminyak or better still pop over to the Gili islands.

Whilst the ocean is pretty, the beach leaves much to be desired. There is a lot of rubbish around and even with shoes on I managed to get a tiny, painful shard of glass embedded in my toe (ouch!). As an Aussie, I don't really expect beaches anywhere else to be as beautiful as ours, but I'm all for staying at your hotel/resort for swimming where it's (hopefully) clean. Obviously, any tourists attract sellers of all kinds, as is only to be expected, so just be aware of that.

Dirty sand, lots of rubbish in the sand and sea. There are too many vendors who come to disturb you to keep buying their stuff or give you massage, etc. I was later informed that between January to February there are lots of rubbish coming in from another part of the sea that gets washed up on the sea. Best to avoid those times and visit when it's cleaner.

I wonder how Kuta beach could make it into the list of top beaches in the lonely planet guide. What we saw was a mountain of plastic, on the beach, behind it, in the water, under the water, sewage water flowing strait into the ocean. The waves were pretty high and most of the time it was prohibited to swim. It was also incredibly loud. This experience will definitely detain us from going to Bali again.

Not sure if its because of the rainy season but the beach was just full of rubbish - I mean piles of it on the sand (discarded water bottles and other debry), you cant even walk along the water - we had piles of rubbish washing around our feet as we tried to walk along.
Ive been here many times before and never experienced this - stay away until fixed.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,201,30>===============  
From my experience, Kuta always dirty like this every December, because of the wind that brought garbage from the sea (if I'm not wrong). I don't really like Kuta, and now, there's tons of place in Bali which have a great beach and lesser seller than Kuta.

We visited here during December, this main one and also one further up which you can see from this beach. It's truly dreadful the amount of litter there is. I haven't seen anything like it and this was on both beaches. We were told it's worse during the peak seasons due to it coming in from other islands, however I find this hard to believe that a beach can be that bad from just other islands. I wouldn't dare go in the water, it was so disgustingly filled with rubbish. People really need to respect nature better, this was awful.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,201,20>===============  
I find the public beach dirty. Not enough trash bins and ended up people are throwing anywhere.The smell of the beach is foul. Straight away we left the moment we stepped in the sand. If you like to swim better go to private beach resorts.

-a big sign said this was unavoidable due to seasonal conditions! but it is the locals rubbish.

The beach and the ocean are excellent. The blue ocean water will definitely refresh you. the brown sand beach is also very nice to relax on. But the bad part I have seen that lots of plastics and plastic products are on the beach. Those are also floating on the ocean water. If you go to the water, you can't enjoy the moment as lots of plastic will be stick on your body.

We wanted to have a look at the beach, but we were harassed so much by people wanting us to buy stuff that we left. My son was quite stressed by it and refuses to go back to the beach, he is 7. In the time I had one beer and he had an ice cream we were bothered by no less than 9 people trying to sell us stuff. One woman refused to leave so we had to move as we couldn't
even talk to each other. I am an experienced traveller and found it annoying but my son found it distressing, as they were taking him by the arm or handing him stuff and expecting me to pay.

Had the misfortune of booking 4 nights in a beachfront hotel in Kuta for New Years. The water is absolutely full of trash and for good reason. They have a huge trash dump on the beach and push the trash into the water when the tides change! Add to that the gauntlet of beach hawkers trying to sell alcohol and the dozens of unemployed young men leering at your wife and whistling at her too and you have absolutely the WORST BEACH IN THE WORLD! Do yourself a favor and stay away from Kuta at all costs!

We checked out Kuta Beach in December 2016; what a dirty and polluted beach. So disappointed and very surprised at how gross it actually was, and that anyone would contemplate walking or sunbaking on the beach, let alone swim in the water. The beach looks nice from a distance, the palm trees at the top of the beach adds to the feel of relaxing and being in the tropics. Then you step on the beach....plastic bottles, condoms, glass bottles, plastic bags and general rubbish all over the beach, especially at the tide line (and people were sunbaking and swimming!). The palm trees at the top of the beach would be lovely to sit around and do some people watching - don't expect to be able to do that. The palm tree area is full of people trying to sell you stuff (pedicure, manicure, sarong, shade and icy drink, wooden trinkets etc etc) there is no sitting and relaxing. If you hesitate or stop, or slow down you are surrounded by people trying to get you to buy something. You get sick of saying "no thank you" every 20 seconds. Best thing to do at Kuta Beach....go to the Hard Rock Café over the road.

The Kuta Beach is a great way to sit an relax, there a small bars along the beach where you can sit and have a cold drink, they will look after you and your belongings while you swim, the merchants selling goods can become annoying but they will give up after awhile, just be polite if you don't want to buy anything.

Have been to Kuta beach many times but shocked to find mountains of plastic waste. The bars, sellers etc pay enough rent to the council so some of this should be ploughed back ( literally) into cleaning up the beach. It's so out of place. U.K. Beachs have machines whic clean up each day. Bali Kuta should do the same.

We reached the Kuta quite late in the afternoon about 4:30pm, take about 1hour to reach the beach from our hotel H Sovereign , Tuban/Kuta, Central City of South Bali.
So windy and big wave on the beach that day ( about December 20th 2016 ), but so many People enjoy and playing at the beach.
I feel the beach is so so, nothing special, not so clean, no good spot to taking good photos, but this is maybe I have not much time to explore the area, because dark night is coming.
But overall we can enjoy it, happy together with our family.

We will come again to explore more next time..

The Kuta beach front is as flat as a salt lake&safe&fun for kids& romancing couples&even oldies with a bad hip, lol. Ther beach is absolutely opposite 5 star hotels, luxury pools & pricey restuarants. The beach offers clean water,cold drinks,cheap massages,safe food& the opportunity to work on your tan safely (if you sit atop your purse or wallet) &mix with the local sellers. I suggest you smile&understand&tolerate these people,as the desperate sellers they are. NB:They are not the typical poor Balinese local, you must venture beyond the beach to see the real Bali folks.Hope this helps you enjoy Paradise Island :-)

The waves at Kuta are a dream for beginner surfers and there is no want for surf schools and cheap bars. But the beach is incredibly filthy, the nightlife noisy and the people in the shops aggressive "hey sexy, you wanna ..." is repeated a million times. That being said, for a quick stopover: mani/pedi, cool lunch and a beer on the beach at sunset watching the last surfers Kuta can be sweet.

We expected to see a beautiful beach, but what we saw was a beach littered with rubbish!

It might be because we visited out of season, but this beach was just plain disgusting.

There was literally rubbish everywhere, there were lots of locals cleaning up but there is far far too much. There are giant stinking rubbish piles all over the beach. There is lots of floaty rubbish in the water.. If you go to even wet your feet bits of rubbish will stick to you.

There are vendors everywhere and lots of beach chairs and people teaching surfing. I think it would be dangerous to surf here, there is big pieces of wood and coconuts on those rubbish piles. Plus you'd probably get rubbish in your mouth. Ewwww

But there were tons of people in the water. Lots of people getting surf classes and people "enjoying" the beach. I don't get it

My advise is don't even bother visiting. It's a waste of time and highly disappointing. At least in the off season. We went to dream beach on Lembongan the next day that is a nice beach.

Efter a month in Bali (Ubud, Munduk, Pemuteran, Amed and Sideman) we decided to go go Kuta to let our children learn to surf. Heard about the plastic on the beach in wetseason but could not beleive it was so bad as it actually is. The plastic is just as much in the water as on the beach! It's depressing ... Like swimming in plastic garbage.

It is our first day here, maybe it is not like this everyday. I really hope Indonesia will do something about the plastic problem! Not only for the tourisme but for the marine life.

Kuta town is nicer than we expected. Touristy of course, but rather atmospheric and lots to do.

Kuta beach is nice just to seat against it and watch the big waves and maybe good for surfers as it has big waves but good for swimming especially because you'll see the first 100 meters which is the swimming area is all mixed with the brown or black sand too much that make the water color is brown so you can't really swim there and you can't snorkel and plus the beach is not too clean as you can see all the plastics rubbish on the beach what make it look bad

Words can't describe it. World famous beach? Wow, world famous rubbish tip with a sand base would be a better description. We have both travelled extensively and even on this trip complained about beach standards in Flores (now more acceptable but a far cry from 'blue flag' But nothing prepared us for the stinking hell hole that is Kuta. Don't go!! Four miles down the road is Jimbaran, a beautiful, clean beach, you might miss your tattoo and piercing parlours, cheap beer and nightclubs, but you get clean and authentic.

Long stretch of beach. Good waves for beginning surfers when we went by there two different days. LOTS of people, including many vendors trying to get you to buy from them. Also people doing manicures, pedicures, massages and selling drinks and food. Know people are trying to make a living, but for those who don't want to be approached or asked to buy regularly you will be annoyed or not relaxed. So if you go, be prepared to have people trying to sell you things or saying 'Yes' as you walk by. If you look at a vendor and/or his/her wares, expect they will try to get you to buy. There was garbage piled up in many places; it was good to see it not strewn over the place, but in piles. However, it would be better as a tourist attraction if this garbage was taken away daily! Expect there to be a lot of traffic on the roads leading to the beach. If you can walk once in the area, you may be better off than sitting in the traffic.

Other than the beautiful sunsets and what could be a nice beach if they cared enough to keep it clean, I don't understand why this place is so popular. Way too crowded and way too much traffic for a relaxing holiday destination. You can't even sit on the filthy beach without being constantly harassed by peddlers. Most restaurants are subpar at best. If you are looking to relax on a nice beach and enjoy good restaurants, I would recommend Benoa over Kuta. If you want to experience Balinese culture, than I'd recommend Ubud. I'm sure there are more nice places on this island, but those are the only others we visited in Bali.

The beach wasn't the cleanest in Bali, but it was still nice. I liked that I could walk on the beach and see sea shells on the sand. What I did not like was that about every 100 yards, someone would try to sell me something. I wanted to be relaxed by the beach not man-handled verbally. So my experience at this beach was not as great as in the other beaches.

Depends on what month you go, it ranges from awful to pretty bad. The locals will tell you a lot of garbage washes up from neighbouring islands and the whole beach gets pretty gross (around Dec to Mar? Might be wrong). I've been when its cleaner, and its still over crowded, hawkers everywhere, and the sand is rough rough rough. Theres better beaches on the island!

The beach is very dirty and you don't want to walk on the beach. Only good for Surfers. The Kuta beach area is very crowded with plenty of dinning and shopping options. Not kids friendly as roads are narrow, mostly unidirectional, with narrow pavements. Choose a nice property(hotel) where kids can enjoy in-house if you would want to stay at Kuta.

Kuta beach is busy with stalls and "bars" but don't be put off. A gentle raise of the hand to hip level and a polite no will usually send them away, don't make eye contact. The "bars" are a great way to sit on the beach, meet new friends and watch the sun set for a couple of dollars a bintang

If I could rate it any lower I would. We spent hard earned money to get here and my heart sank when we saw it. Almost more rubbish than sand. Beyond disappointing. The Balinese should be ashamed. Why people come here is beyond me. This is a tourist trap on an epic scale.

Best is the "Beach Walk" around the shore that is quite nice to walk in the evenings. Some stretches are not very neat but the path way is quite clean mostly and goes through several beach resort properties so it makes it a nice and interesting view both sides!!

This beach could be great but unfortunately it isn't due to the consequences of poor tourism management. The amount of hassle you get at the beach is pretty annoying, but worse the amount of rubbish in the water and piled on the sand makes the beach pretty bad. I swam last year, this year we didn't bother.

As people said there is the best point for sunset so we straight to go as we arrived.But unluckily was cloudy so we just look around.The view are really georgeous but not the environment.When we were there plastic and bottle everywhere on the sand.Honestly we are sad to see that how can people harm the environment treasure like Kuta.My sister in law tried to swim but she hurt her feet by the piece of broken glass this should not happen in famous place as tourist destination.

Kuta beach at this time of year is full of rubbish. Loads and loads of rubbish. The locals use bulldozers to push the debris into mounds unto higher ground. Walking along the shore guarantees some kind of plastic wrap sticking to your feet. Still huge numbers on the beach with many learning how to surf. Life goes on

I don't know how anyone can sugarcoat it - this beach is literally a stinking trash heap. Except on the small stretches of beach tended by resorts the amount of rotting, washed up trash (mostly plastic detritus, but other stinky funk, as well) is staggering.

First time I've been to a beach and be greeted by gasping tourists. The beach is not safe to walk nor swim. The surface of the beach is carpeted by a layer of trash.

Save for party goers where fun don't stop no matter where they are.

When you come to Bali, people here will say to you, "Do not say that you've been to Bali when you're not visited Kuta beach"

I do agree. This crowded beach still have one its best, sunset.

You will see so many people here. Restaurants and hotels is easy to find at this location.

Walk on the beach is nice thing to do while you will see this beach is one of the famous surfing spot in Bali as well.

Come here at the sunset time, and you will never regret it.

Kuta beach can be a beautiful place to sit on the beach with a cold beer and watch the sunset however this time of year it is covered in rubbish and I would have thought the government would put more assets into cleaning up the beach a bit more.

I love the hustle and bustle of Kuta and then finding retreat in Satriya Cottages on Poppies II. There are some groovy little streets where you will find reasonably priced warungs and spa and massage for good prices. In the main Legian Street you may pay a little more but still all good. People are friendly. You can find the odd stall at the market that has set prices that makes shopping so much nicer without having to barter.
Shame that the beaches are terrible. Apparently all the rubbish gets washed in from Java at this time of the year. You would think you were in the slums of Manila on some parts of the beach where they collect and mount the rubbish. This being said lots of praise for the Balinese who Day after day relentlessly try and clean up the beach to make it appealing. $50,000 IRD for a 30 minute massage at the beach watching the sunset with a $25,000IRD bintang... lovely!!!

We truly enjoyed the stay at Kuta beach with waves that were just right for us to attempt mounting a surf board for the first time. However, the beach is suffering from the environmental catastrophe that Bali is facing: during the rain, the plastic that's dumped in rivers in Bali is swept to sea, and back onto shores like the one in Kuta. Mountains of plastic (and flotsam) are swept up on to the beach (and some remains in the water). The authorities and beachfront hotels are doing their best to tidy up the beaches as soon as they can, but there is a steady inflow of trash that tarnishes this paradise.

As soon as u sit down he will connect you to the wifi but then come the beggars and people selling u bracelets, massages, manicures, pedicures, bow and arrows, cigarettes, makeup. Bit of a struggle to get them away just have to keep saying NO but at one point i was getting a 30min neck massage and my nails painted all for $10UAD.

The last time I was in Kuta was 36 years ago. I did not return until now due to Bali belly and the plastic in the water in Kuta. Bali belly appears fixed, the people are still wonderful but the plastic and rubbish is much worse.
We have just spent 6 weeks in Bali. We have been to Nusa Dua, Canggu, Sanur, Ubud the mountains and Nusa Penida. At last my wife asked to go shopping in Kuta and as we walked toward to beach I saw the waves and thought we had made a mistake as they were big and beautiful. Then as we got closer we saw the plastic and rubbish in the waves were terrible. The rubbish at the tide line was awful.
I suggest everybody staying in Kuta post that they will not come back until the rubbish problem is fixed so something will be done. This is not a high tech issue and something needs doing now.
Plastic bags need to be banned now, people need to stop leaving rubbish everywhere so it gets into drains and rivers and the beaches should be cleaned like in Nusa Dua (but even more so). Get public servants to pick up the rubbish every day. Dar es Salam had a similar problem on their main road and fixed it in a few months. Work out how to make fishing lines that catch plastic and that will help. I really can't see why anybody with functioning eyes would come back.

We stayed in Kuta for ten days and tried to go swimming in the Kuta beach a few times with no luck! There were tens of vendors selling various items scouring the beach for potential buyers. The water was not clean at all and was quite littered with empty bottles, plastics of all kinds and the like. You cannot expect anything close to the clean beaches we have here in Australia. Unlike the beach, we very much liked the Kuta area because it is located close to everything you might need ranging from Waterbom and superb restaurants to money changers, malls, and tourist agencies.

We went to Bali for our honeymoon. My husband has been to beaches before as well but this was my first time on a beach and I was like "seriously? Are beaches this dirty?" I mean I was so disappointed when I stepped into Kuta beach. Cans, rotten fruits, beer bottles, and dirty nappies littered the beach mostly. I mean my dream of running around bare foot on the sand like in the movies, was shattered then and there. I infact did not take more than a step or two, just stood there watched the sea and came back. That was my Kuta beach experience.

We were looking forward to hanging out at the famous Kira beach but were disappointed the moment we arrived. There were literally likes of trash and debris every 25 feet and you could see the trash floating in the water all over. We were told this is a problem during the winter months due to the winds blowing all the flotsam trash to the Kuta /Legian beach area but don't know if the problem entirely goes away at other times of the year.

We also found the touts and hawkers the most aggressive at Kuta beach. Many just kept pestering even after told a polite no a few times.

Overall Kuta ranks as one of our least favorite places in all of Bali.

We visited the beach over 3 days. Not the cleanest beach. One of the days during low tide, the beach was polluted with wood debris and plastic bottles. But still a good beach to walk along.

I believe this is a nice beach. But, during Nov-March, the wind brings all the rubbish up to the west coasts of Bali, causing all beaches incl. Kuta to be extremely dirty.

Great beach to surf for novice. For those who are not keen on surfing, can enjoy the massage, pedicure/manicure , temporary tattoo services or hair braiding services by the beach. Surfing board with or without trainers are available too. What interest me most is that the locals are committed to ensure that the beach is well maintained. Manage to witness their beach clean up in the morning, announcement is made for assistance to clear the rubbish before the tide rise. All the peddlers and locals there rush to help with the clean up. It is simply an amazing experience.

Over the years this beach has ranged from being very clean to being virtually polluted. Today it lies somewhere in between with lots of plastic, rubbish and water borne rubbish. There was a big clean-up under way, it seems the beach has being undergoing a clean-up for the past week as a result of the huge volumes of rubbish; mostly vegetation and tree off-cuts and branches with some hard waste. No one is sure where this rubbish originates, depending on tidal and wind patterns it maybe comes from Bali's super tip.
You also run the gauntlet of vendors as soon as you set foot on the beach. They are in your face constantly, refuse to take 'no' for an answer, it's just hassle, hassle, hassle. Same with the massage ladies. Probably only spent 10 minutes at the Kuta end but it was enough. I realise people are trying to eke out a living, BUT IF GOING TO KUTA BEACH I WOULD RECOMMEND EAR MUFFS AND WRAP AROUND REFLECTIVE LENS. I think beaches like Kuta are the main reason that I am not a beach lover.

Horrible place full of horrible people.
Both local and tourist people.
No stop hassle from sellers. No peace on beach to relax. Always someone waiting to pounce on tourists to sell, sell sell.
I drove up to the top of Bali and found deserted beaches there. Rocky but empty.
If you are looking for the Bali Experience get out of the tourist toilet bowl of the Kuta Seminyak Legian tourist area and go to the North coast.
You won't be sorry or hassled.

The beach is filthy to the brink. I will not advice anyone who is looking to spend a relaxing holiday next to the beach to visit Kuta Beach. The locals did advice that the reason why the beach was so dirty was due to the fact that during the rainy season all the dirt and debris from Java washes up on the beach in Kuta. This is in my view is not an excuse and if not attended to by the Government visitors will never again come to Kuta , at least I will never again visit Kuta.

The constant harassment of the street hawkers are unacceptable. Whilst I do understand that people want to make a living, being from Africa myself, the level of intimidation and rudeness of the hawkers in Kuta is unprecedented. In certain instances they even went so far to pull at me.

The cost of food and drinks in Kuta are also simple exorbitant but I do presume that the only cater visitor from Australia.

Watch you credit card. My card was cloned , be careful where you draw money or were you swipe your card. Rather take enough dollars with and go and exchange it at a reputable exchange agent.

Finally if you want to party and drink go to Kuta but otherwise stay away.

Beautiful bay with hotels at the waters edge. Unfortunately the beach is covered with an enormous amount of plastic rubbish. Mostly a type of indonesian drink container. I've never seen anything like it and being such a tourist destination, gobsmacked that local government doesn't clean it up.

We expected a clean beach. Contrary to our expectations, the beach was actually very dirty (garbage: loads of it).

We have been told that it is a seasonal thing and we saw all the garbage because we visited in December. However looking at all the garbage all along the coastal line it was hard to believe that it was a seasonal thing.

It was a clean beach with beautiful sand, you have places so you can clean with water from the sand of your feet.

just awefull!!!
Kuta Beach is crowded (Most are locals and drunk Australian tourists), really dirty (They don't clean it up, they just pile it together on the sides (Maybe clean it at the end of the season, who knows) The locals are pushy and try to sell you anything (Surf lessons, scooters, girls, massages,... Can't tell you how many times they tried to sell drugs to me, eventhough drugs are punished with the death-penalty)
The traffic is horrible but its best to take a taxi if you go out or they just keep annoying you all the way down to the pubs/restaurants.
This is not Paradise!!! stay away from Kuta Beach!!!!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,216,30>===============  
If in Bali, you have to experience this beach. The markets are also very close and there are many shops, pubs and restaurants.
Be very very firm when you get to the beach as they will try and sell you anything and everything. They tried to paint my daughters nails and i told them it was very nice of them to do this for free. They stopped straight away.
You can do surf lessons or just relax at one of the pub/restaurants right on the beach. These beaches dont compare to anything in Australia, not even close.
For food, look at Fat Tony's and Bamboo Bar.

well rather grand title " bar" , plastic chairs and a small table, but jut on the beach 50 yerds to the left of the main entrance , in front of a block of clean toilets, , sit under the trees on the top of the beach watching the world go by with cold beers at 25k rp each ( around 1.60 UKP)

Kuta Beach might have been more pristine some time back- however its looking a little tired now. Watch out for street hawkers and gawkers as well. Ok to sit back, sip on a coconut and watch the planes land on the nearby Bali airport runway.

This bech is ok.. not quite what I expected. A bit messy/not the most cleanest beach I've been to. A beach chair cost around IDR 50,000 for 1 hour. Haggle if you can.

For many years, Kuta beach still impressed me for holiday. Not only for it's location but also the atmosphere and surrounded by many hotels and restaurants and mall. Watching sunset is the best part on here.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,217,10>===============  
I honestly do not know why anyone would go to the beach here... From first view the sand is oil polluted with rubbish all over people trying to sell you anything u can think of every 5 seconds. Also in the water there is rubbish floating everywhere and the beach is overall sketchy not safe to leave your belongings on to go for a swim. The beach is officially ruined..

Just went to Kuta beach on my first day here in Bali, I'm not impressed. I'm sure it must be beautiful at sundown, but I imagine that is the only draw along with the beautiful entrance I posted a picture of along with this review. The beach is filthy and the water that washes ashore is even more filthy. I was surprised how many people were surfing in it. Not the worst beach I've seen, but I definitely do not need to return to it ever again either.

This place was painful. Extremely painful. We all here about the iconic beaches of bali and this place does not live up to that. There is garbage everywhere. Mostly lining the shore and then in piles all over the beach. You aren’t allowed to swim- surf only. Every five feet there is the same thing a few chairs on the beach, a guy with a cooler of beer yelling at you to sit in them or rent a surfboard for him. Over and over and over for miles. We walked until we hit one or two restaurants then decided to not give money to this place at all. If you want to go to a nice beach, head to the other side of the island to Segara (Northern Sanur) beach.

Love this beach. So clean and the water was great. Me and my husband spent some time here. The only downside was, it was too crowded with locals selling food and snacks

We've been several times to Kuta beach, the atmosphere is great. However in the wet season there is plenty of rubbish along the beach.

When we went swimming we were constantly running into plastic bags and other items of rubbish in the water.

I wouldn't recommend swimming in the water with children.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,217,30>===============  
We have been here three times now, and never seen it as dirty with rubbish as this time. We were disappointed with the trash every where and the ladies selling things on the beach are getting worse ever Year

We have been there one day early in the morning!the beach was overcrowded and was dirty with rubbish and plastic bottles!i think that there are better beaches than this!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,217,10>===============  
avoid this beach if you can! It is filthy, full of garbage, the water is disgusting and people are constantly haggling you to purchase items from them. We stayed in kuta for 4 nights and only went in the water once, and only for about 15 mintues before we decided it was way to gross to continue swimming in it. There is much better options for beaches in Bali. Yes Kuta is known for surfing, but you can get just as good surf further north on the beach on Echo beach and near Canggu where the water seemed to be cleaner and the beach was more laid back and not as heavily touristed.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,217,40>===============  
As usual, many locals are there to promote their business. The special thing is most business here are based on surfing. You can noticed alot of people are surfing on the waves there and I think it's a good place for first timers to surf.

Unbelievably filthy, littered and disgusting beach full of annoying and very persistant shoppers. OK you can watch sunset over the sea that looks fine but lets be honest every sunset over the sea looks at least fine.

Never went swimming as I could not imagined myself swimming between all that floating rubbish.

Just choose different cleaner and less crowded beach...period!

The water isn't to bad here but you can't relax with the non stop beach salesmen harassing you. Some won't take no for an answer the first few times you say it. Not hygienic at all.

First day first time in Bali and bammmmn! you are under attack from the moment you step onto the beach. Such a turn off. Beach was dirty, think we have better beaches here in New Zealand to be honest. The constant street people trying to sell you something just became so much we never went back!. Better at Nusa Dua beach where at least you have to be registered to sell you something.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,218,30>===============  
Nice open and clean beach to laze around. You can relax cause they had control on people haggling you to but their products.

Great for the experience, but very frustrating constantly being hassled to buy things, massage or manicure. Buy one thing and then it's open season on you, but hey it's Bali. Beer and drinks cheap and ice cold, so it's not all bad. Can recommend Paul's Bar

I have been at Kuta beach before and was surprised to see how extremely dirty the beach was now. The say it is the season and that the dirt is coming from the sea. We could see a lot of dirt in the sea as well so I guess it is right. They need a system to get it of the beach as soon as possible to not scare people of.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,218,20>===============  
By far the worst beach I have ever been! It is extremely dirty with all the plastic rubbish being washed up from the sea. Even though the beach is really long and wide I left after a short walk cause I could imagine myself swimming or just relaxig on the beach. Further from the sea the beach is cleaner and with lots of sun beds but still you can see the mess. Good waves for surfing though but as I said I would not go into the sea cause I felt disgusted by the mess. Go to Nusa Dua for much much nicer beaches!

I went to bali in June 11-14 as my birthday gift to myself. Planning for the trip .... I still had a lot of apprehensions but when I arrived all my fears were gone. I felt at home at the neighborhood . I stayed at Kuta SeaView was good hotel. There were a lot of bars and restaurants and souvenir shops around. I totally enjoyed it.

I didn't come to Bali to see this beach at all. But I'm here so I wanted to take a look. It's sad, very sad. There is so much trash that is washed up. We walked for 10 minutes along the shore line then had to leave.

Lots of litter and people trying to sell stuff to every person walking by. I don't mind that people are making a living but when I want to buy something I will come to you. Beach needs a bit of a clean, but I guess tourists are the problem, so, take your litter home with you or put it in a bin please, it'll make everyone's experience better.

Thanks

Well, except perhaps to hire the plastic chairs and sit under the trees and have a few drinks.
The beach itself is more like dirt than sand, and there's rubbish along the water's edge, and bitey things in the water!
Swim in your hotel pool, walk along Kuta beach (or sit under a tree) so you can say "been there, done that"!

The beach was clean and has a great view. The beach was crowded with tourist which made the beach very lively, however there were so many touters that came and was very persistant. Even if they left, another one came right after which made it a little difficult to actually enjoy.

I would recommend walking down towards Padma or Legian beach for a quieter beach. (fewer touters and they are not as persistant)
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,220,20>===============  
How disgusting. Firstly getting off the tender boat from the cruise ship was a shock. The rubbish in the water is disgusting. I can't believe the locals feel that is ok for their visitors first impression. Then you get bombarded with cab drivers that want your business. Literally hoards of people swarming you.
After a terrible ride in the back of a 'van', with no seat belts, we get to Kuta beach. Swarmed again by every manner of person trying to sell you fake Rolexes to fake sports wear. They actually grab your arm and try to drag you into their stall.
Horrible. Then the beach itself had rubbish strewn all over the place. Stinking and smouldering bomb fires from revelers the night before, no doubt. Just disgusting. I am so glad we never went to Bali for a holiday. We would have been terribly disappointed. At least stopping off while on a cruise meant we could get out of there as soon as we could.
YUCK.

Visited the beach in the afternoon with plans to sun bath and watch the sunset. However, we found the beach to be very dirty with a lot of flotsam being washed up. We eventually dropped the idea of sun bathing.

Petitentget beach is much nicer in comparison although it is just slightly further north from Kuta beach.

A gd beach to walk n chill. Altho not that clean. Busy with surfers, instructors,peddlars, massage. But what is kuta beach without these. Definitely must go if u are staying kuta. But not ideal for kids under 5yr old to play in the waters coz waves is quite dangerous.

A very famous beach. The sand was dark though. While it's a famous tourist spot, I wasn't spared when it comes to locals forcing me to buy they souvenirs all the time. We were coerced to rent a shade with benches and seeing that there was no one lying down on the beach using their beach mats, we decided to rent one for an hour.

At the southern end of Kuta Beach just past the small fishing fleet you will find the traditional area for cremation ceremonies. Just inland from the beach is the poor people's cemetery and it's the site where many people gather to conduct the ceremonies. I only saw the very end of it.

Don't come to Kuta for the beach unless you are on a strict budget. The surfing is not compelling, the scenery is below average. I wonder about water quality, also.

A very hectic and busy beach, but a great place to people watch as well as watch the sunset in the evening. Go buy a takeaway meal and just sit on the beach and watch the sunset. There are plenty of beach vendors so just try to situate yourself away from them.

There are many cleaners cleaning up the beach every morning. Mostly are the natural flotsam like branches and logs. Thus, the beach is very clean and suitable for swimming and surfing. The waves can be pretty strong at high tide though.
My children enjoyed walking far into the shallow beach frolicking in the water. If you stayed for the sunset, you'll be rewarded with a very beautiful one.
The only downside is that there is no wash up area for our kids. Thus, got to walk back with the sand on their feet and body.
Overall, best beach with great sunset.

I guess everyone who wants to go to Bali imagen the white sandy beaches and get a bit disappointed when their at Kuta. Kuta Beach is full of garbage and local sellers. If you´re going to Bali make sure you visit the islands and I highly recommend The Gili's. I've been both in 2011 and went back in October 2015, I love Bali! Enjoy!

North Kuta beach is perfect in case you decided to learn how to surf. There are a lot of surfing schools around and waves all the time. But in case you would like to spend time on the beach- this is not the right place. There is one narrow dedicated area for swimming and there are high waves. No umbrellas on the beach and no shower. A lot of tourists spend their day at the pool side of hotel. If you would like to have beach holiday- better choose south Kuta or Nusa Dua- quite beach with white sand. We had great time learning how to surf every day! Odysseys surf school is highly recommended, prices are not high and service is perfect! Location near the beach, good instructors, insurance, surf wear, shower, changing room, pictures and videos from you lesson :) Sunset is good here.

Pros: very cheap beer

Cons: filthy beach, yes it's the end of a wet season but it was hard to step anywhere that there wasn't rubbish (including a used condom might I add). The sand was also very grey. From the state of it we didn't bother going in.

Obviously its very touristy and you have to try and pick a spot where there is less people in the surf but thats not too hard.

Kuta Beach is clean, sandy and plenty of stalls with beach bed to rest your tired body after enjoy swimming in the sea, drinks and eat. Kuta beach is good for learn surfing and also enjoy the wave.
If you enjoy the incoming aircraft heading to land on DPS airport, sit down to relax and enjoy. After enjoying at Kuta Beach, walk across the road, enjoy shopping, good foods at Starbucks, Hard Rock Cafe, local foods, just to name a few.
The sea water at Kuta Beach is clear and children love to play with the sand to crate animals shape and house. You can see owner bring their dog to swim with them and the dog enjoy the sea.

There are lots of tour operators on beach front but one should be cautious in finalising prices as there is over charging by some agencies.Surfing equipment can be hired and there are also guides helping those interested to learn.Be careful with touts and massage offering agents.

A Nice beach with a beautiful sunset. They've got tables and chairs for you to sit for free, even tho they probably prefer for you to buy some drink but they will still be super nice! You can rent surfboards and they might help you learn a bit.Too many sellers walking around where some will almost beg you to buy on a bad day...

Kuta beach is great for a stroll depending on the tide. Also people can be persistant in trying to sell their trinkets and massages but move along quickly if they can see you are not interested. A work party do a rubbish pick up along the beach in the early morning which makes it nice and clean before all the crowds.
Negotiate surfboard hire and check the rates.
Can find a nice beachbreak along the beach, depends on the tide as it can sometimes dump full shorey.

The main part of kuta beach is crazy busy with lots of local bars on the Sand available.

Best time is to go down just before sunset and watch from the beach.

Be warned you will have people come up to you every 5 mins trying to see you something

We loved to sit on Kuta Beach at night back in the day and watch the planes arriving. Nowadays its busy even at night.

In the day it's way too crowded and there are too many pushy vendors. There is also an increasingly large amount of garbage on the beach, left behind by inconsiderate scum.

The ocean is still beautiful with its huge, crashing breakers..

A nice clean and safe beach for taking a dip and even trying surfing on small tides.
The beach has many shacks with food and others with surf boards and beach canopies with beach chairs at an hourly rate.
Hawkers do irritate you for selling trinkets, getting tattoos or foot spa.
But a nice place to relax and watch clear clean sea waters and white sandy beach

We saw the most beaches in the world !
That Beach and Sea was so magical and Amazing!
It has beautiful sunrise and sunset
It has parking lot for motorcycle and it was very close to many restaurants and supermarkets!
The sea has very interesting swelling and low depth!

You should try it even for 1 time!
It was very Lovely experience!

the best place for surfing, but better after 11am,
i tried to surf at 6am......
its too peace on the seaside.
the sand are soft and sea water is not stink,

and the people(vendor) is so cute,
try to sell you a thing from 420,000 and reduce to 50,000.
you can rent a board there, only need 50,000 per time.

any way, I might just go there every year,
its the best place for surfing

We stayed across the street from Kuta Beach. Must say, it's a pretty busy beach day in and out! There is always a bunch of people surfing and the vendors on the beach are always there to try and offer you a beer, massage, hair style, etc. The sand is very soft and the water was always warm.

The beach is nice and overall pretty clean.

The problem is that it's truly a surf beach...So surfers everywhere, swim here is not allowed or risky...
The other problem is that you have TONS of merchants everywhere selling...almost anything!

The walls between the beach and the road is a wonder. It's almost better to walk along the road than the beach...too bad

It was my 4th visit to Kuta and the beach is getting dirtier and dirtier. The locals there were pretty annoying they kept making slur words and it was unpleasant. This could probably another good place for surfer.
What makes no sense at all, there used to be free taps where we could wash our feet from the sand, but now we have to pay for clean water. Thank the Lord our hotel is located across the beach, we could clean our feet with free and clean water the hotel provided near the parking lot.

I really found Kuta beach to be better than it was last time I was there. It was clean and beautiful. I even found the Chair and beer vendors really friendly and not pushy. In fact we hung out with some of these guys one evening and they were great. Don't get me wrong Kuta is a busy beach. But it's huge with a great surf and no rocks or coral. We loved it!!

This beach has small gravel instead of typical sand which we find in our beaches in India. The water is cold guys like chilled in the fridge, beware of the waves in low tide that were 5 foot high. Don't swim if you are not comfortable with the huge waves. Warning you might occasionally see nude Australian men and women in the beach. Do explore the fantastic shacks on this beach and beyond in the never ending night life of Bali.

before the inna kuta beach hotel was re-build we stayed there a few times & always enjoyed the beach & watching the surf & young surfers fight the big waves, I liked my early morning walks along the waters edge watching the activity, the tractor rake cleaning all the sand woman picking up rubbish leaving the beach nice & clean which is a big step forward as only a few years ago rubbish would be piling up & even raw sewage would be flowing in-to the sea, this is all in the past & good news for a busy & beautiful waterfront enjoyed by so many tourists & locals alike, with all the beach traders busy preparing for the sunset trade where during a night with big surf you can actually see the sun set through the wave just before it breaks.hire a lounge & read, swim, relax

The wave is good for surfing but of course depend on season. We stay at the hotel opposite the beach so just a small walk to the beach. There is also a lot of merchants there offering tattoo services, massaging, surfing and if u need a beach deck then pay for it. Normal price to surf is 30k for 2 hours but feel free to bargain. The coaches there are quite professional and friendly

P.s go in early morning to get a good price if u want to surf u might can get lower than 150k for 2 hours.

For first timer u should come here first, u could just sit in d sand or stroll by taking picture.
They will offer you to twist ur hear or massage and they have umbrellas with chairs and cold drink to serve (but becarful, if you dont want to buy something dont sit there, they will charge you still, but i think d price of d beer or softdrinks is still reasonable)
Or you could just sun bathed or watch other people surf.
But the beach is rather crowded sometimes especially on holiday season coz many local tourist is making kuta beach as they prior itinerary

Although, it was too hot to really enjoy the beach , the water was beautiful; trying to find shade was hard!! Their are small chairs which seemed to be always taken( I don't know if you paid to get a chair, or, it was first come first serve!)
Otherwise, their is a lovely beach path, mostly shaded, to stroll along the beachfront . Lots of hawkers , too. I specifically would go down later in the day to watch the beautiful sunsets . All day, it was a surfers paradise; always fun to watch those getting lessons; to the more seasoned surfers!!

Huge beach full of surfers, sunbathers and local children asking to speak with you and take your picture.

Good fun for swimming, wave jumping and sunbathing.

The local kids are cute practicing their English with you but can get annoying after the 7th or 8th child, all asking the same questions.

Sun beds are quite expensive at 100,000 per hour but can be bartered down quite considerably.

Graf sunset views. Buy a Bintang from a convenience store and sit down just back from the waves' reach.

Had a look down on the beach. Decided to rent one of the beach lounges for $5 and have a few Bintangs which were 25k each.

It's one of those iconic beaches of the world and to finally set foot on was a great experience. I first travelled down early morning - which was great - the full-on touristy side was not evident which made a better impression on me. Visited later in the day on a number of occasions - one for the standard Bintang at Sunset, one for a beach walk around midday and once late at night. The Bintang at sunset was great and was not harassed by too many hawkers. The beach walk at Midday and subsequent bottle of cold water was picturesque but full on tourist mode was in operation and the hawkers were a little intrusive. Not much happening on the beach itself a bit later at night and the crowds had obviously moved into the nightclubs etc. And yes another must visit perhaps before you head off to the less touristy locales.

We were looking forward to spending time and enjoying ourselves at the world famous Kuta Beach but ended up being disappointed. We had intended to swim and enjoy ourselves on the beach but found the beach to be a public beach and crowded full of people every day from tourists, locals, peddlers selling stuff, surfboard hiring stand etc. We didn't have much privacy at all with peddlers constantly harassing us selling their wares.

The beach itself could have been cleaner as found rubbish either washed up or littered on the beach. I actually found a broken piece of bottle glass on the beach. The beach has an incline into the sea but it becomes rather flat from there onwards.

Due to the crowd we didn't end up swimming once in the sea. We just brought our 3 year old boy to play in the sand. We didn't even bring him to wade in the water as we felt it wasn't safe and clean.

Kuta beach has hawkers by the score, kitsch and tack salesmen pimping the same cheap memorabilia you saw yesterday and the day before, on every stall in Bali, the same stuff again, but more forcefully. Girls and older women offer massages galore. I love Bali towels and blowpipes made of bamboo, you get all you can stand then you scream at one of them: stay away from me! That just brings more. AT one point I had 7 or 8 hawkers around me, some sitting, some kneeling, others at my back. Flies were less common. Escape into the rough sea to avoid them but do take a surfboard with you, for protection against the surfers. Swimming here is deadly. Surf brings dangers as out of control learners and careless surfboard pilots head for you at speed. Get out of Kuta for peace and quiet and safer seas.

Beautifull beach with fine sand and a lots of surffing intructor who offers surffing classes. One can enjoy walkling along the beach, sunbathing or surfing. Surffing is quite a fun. When one is at the Kuta beach, must try surffing class.

Kuta beach is a hive of activity, many tourists frequent the beach. Each day in Kuta we would go to the same spot and be greeted by Wayan a local who sold beer and refreshments. He would ensure we had a comfortable seat in the shade and that we always had a refreshment. There are many local sellers along the beach who approach you to buy their goods, they are polite and generally will move on once told you aren't interested, some are a little more passionate about a sale and you need to be firm at times. The water is beautiful and blue and there was nothing more relaxing than sitting on the beach with a beverage watching the waves. A must do for relaxation when in Kuta.

Average beach overcrowded with people trying to sell you stuff. Much nicer beaches in other areas such as Legian or Seminyak . Would not bother to go out of your way to visit.

If you're new to surfing it's a great place to learn. You can hire a teacher for cheap and it well worth it! Great waves for both beginner and experienced. The beach is r ally busy tho so if that kind of stuff turns you off you make not want to visit. If you plan on sitting in the shade u will have to buy a drink from a merchant to get a chair/table. The water is beautiful and the beach is clean from what I saw. Sellers will consistently ask you to buy their wares which is the norm in most of Bali. Say no politely and firm and they'll eventually will get the point. Take advantage for the cheap pedicures and manicured and/or massages if you're into those things. They do a spectacular job!

I will never go back.. ripped off by constant hawkers.. the started doing my hair and nails charged me too much.. would not take no for an answer. My husband feels that i may have had my drink spiked and this appears to ring true as i am usually good at being strong and say no but i felt i couldnt. My husband noticed the drinks guy give a policeman money. By the time he had worked it out it was.too late.
We were on a cruise ship so after this we went back to the ship. If i ever go to bali i will definately ensure i have tours and be safe.

I prefer Bingit Beach, Nusa Dua Beach or Pecatu Beach compare to Kuta beach.

It's too easy to access that is why too much people's and too crowded.

If you love stronger wave and quiter go to Bingit or Pecatu Beach. If you don't stay at fancy hotels which is have private beach, rent motor cycle or private car go to Nusa Dua Beach, Pecatu or Bingit to enjoy better view. Jimbaran Beach also one of the options besides they have so many restaurants, you can enjoy the beach and take shower provide by local peoples with only pay 5 cents and rent umbrella with relax chairs.

The pictures I show you here is the Jimbaran Beach Bali. There is sea food Restaurant called ROMAN, best of the best and inexpensive.

I really enjoy my time in this beach in morning because it was on working days and not so many people coming at that time but most of tge time this beach will be so packed.
But now this beach is clean so people can come enjoy with family, playing ball in the beach, swimming, surfing or even bring their pets to this beach.
In here we can rent the surfing board and also they renting a umbrella seat around 50.000 rupiah or 100.000 rupiah sometimes for tourist so u better bargain with them. If u don't want to pay u can just simply seat in the sands in the beach.
This beach is very close to many choices of cafe's with live music in night, club, restaurants and also hard rock cafe.
We can also find many option of hotel across the kuta beach from 3 star until 5 star hotel.

I cannot say that the beaches are the best. I am biased and still think that Australian beaches are the most beautiful.

Why? Bali has intensely beautiful beaches. This is not one of them as it is really an urban beach today as opposed to what it must have been when Kuta was jungle, doesnt have dazzling sand or water, has insane amounts of Java tourists who land up in busloads of whom the men smoke incessantly and throw their trash on the beach, has no food. Who is it good for? Surfers, and beginning surfers for lessons, and for Javanese tourists who hang out here for a few hours and then eat at the egregious large restaurants set up for them across the noisy ocean avenue. I stayed in Kuta and disliked this beach, and spent my days exploring the island. You won't see any Balinese culture here either, as most surf vendors are from other parts of Indonesia, and they too chain smoke. Though, this beach does have trees lining the back, which is good to lounge under. Pandawa is a beautiful beach. And there are many more. Avoid Kuta, or lounge once to get it out of your syetm.

Kuta Beach is also minutes away drive from the Ngurah Rai International Airport in Tuban, therefore quite well located. The time were were there was quite busy since there was a movie scene being filmed at the beach - however it was something new for us to watch and quite exciting. Wouldn't recommend the place for poeple seeking some quite oasis within the city (choose quiet Pandawa Beach instead short drive with a motorcycle)! - Kuta Beach is bustling with life!

It appears that some "beach purists" don't appreciate Kuta. We, however, thoroughly enjoyed ourselves on this beach. Clean water, clean sand, charming spots (like Andy's) to get some chairs and a Coca Cola. Boogie boarding was tons of fun - the waves can be a bit brutal at times!

Don't go if you are offended by people trying to sell you ice cream or bows and arrows. Hey - if that's the worst that can happen, then things are pretty doggone good!

Went three evenings in a row to watch the sunset. Remarkable. Truly. It is overwhelming to see the mass of humanity that comes out to appreciate nature's humble show.

Recommend!

After the busy week it's always good to have a day out in Kuta Beach walking along the sandy beach and played with waves while waiting for the sun is set! Especially on Saturdays you could try if the turtle conservation will release the baby turtles, as it's not every week the female turtle give birth and produce eggs. It was a free program but you are welcome to donate to support this conservation. If you could be there before 4PM is good otherwise you will not get the ticket to get your container and baby turtle to release. As children are enthusiastic, they are prioritized than the adults, but adults still can get chance as long as the baby turtle is still available..To find the location, you'd better walk through the Kuta Art Market heading to beach then turn right about 100 meters, you will see the big turtle statue and that is the camp of turtle conservation in Kuta Beach. Great experience for kids and everyone! especially for the awareness of saving and loving the animals and natures.

We love to walk the beach from Kuta art market to Seminyak each morning at this time of the year as the tide is usually low & the beach clean & flat to walk on, a great way to get a quick tan.
The many beach bars offer very cold drinks under lovely palm trees to watch the sun set over the ocean, where you are also offered sarongs, Jewelery, sunglasses, pedicures, massages actually pretty well anything you might want, as long as you like to bargain because it often more expensive on the beach than in the shops.
Many people love to swim & surf here as well.

Long beach (more than 3 KM), with white sands, very nice for swimming, not too much deep water till far inside the sea.
Strong waves that are very suitable for surfing.

I like to consider myself a seasoned traveler. When traveling to Indonesia Kuta beach is a top destination for surfers, and tourist alike. However keep in mind there's many other splendid beaches where the surf is just as good, sunsets and sunrises can be enjoyed without the constant hawkers and foot traffic. We purchased a couple beers, headed down to catch the sunset but were hugely disappointed by the constant hecklers trying to braid my hair, massage my feet, sell me bracelets, wallets, shells, fruit, flowers...... We couldn't even enjoy a conversation amongst ourselves due to the constant disruptions. We ended up leaving and giving our beverages away. Not worth the trouble. Even when you say NO, they begin rubbing your shoulders, or playing with your hair. Not cool. The beach itself is beautiful and the amenities adjacent to the beach give many options for shopping and eating.

Not what was expected. Clean and peaceful with a few vendors trying to sell things, but unlike other places I've been they accept a no and move on.

Well I didnt like that every 1 min came somebody trying to sell me whatever. You can not really relax on Kuta beach. Water is dirty, u literally surfing between rubbish.
I anyway tried to be nice to locals and became friends with few surfer dudes. I had good time with them in the water, they looked after me and tried to teach me a bit of surfing and also protect me on the beach. So I was happy invited them for cold beer after..however If I would be better surfer I never go to Kuta- Aussie destination nbr one. Bali has much more to offer!

Nice public beach which can get crowded! Lot of places to learn surfing! Lots of small beach huts to sit by. They will keep your stuff with them whilst you take a dip in the sea for a small fee of drinks.
The sea is quite calm and pleasant. So it's good fun to take a dip. The sun can get bad so suggest to go either early morning or late afternoon from around 4pm. Use sun bloc!!! You do get troubled by various people trying to sell or offer stuff but when you politely refuse them they don't bother you after that. All in all it's a nice place but it can get crowded.

What a nightmare!
We were in Bali for 10 days and spent 3 days in Kuta. I decided that I wanted to go to the beach itself instead of spending every day in the hotel pool. It was horrible! People come to you every 2 minutes and don't take no for an answer. They offer their service and even if you say "no, thanks", they stay around nagging and if their offering a service (massage, hair braiding,...) they start doing it so you have to be more emphatic and say that you don't want and won't pay for it. I pretended I was asleep to have 5 min of peace but they kept coming (and it didn't help that my fiancee kept chatting to them!).
If you want a nice beach experience while you're in Bali, go to Legian!

Iconic Kuta is on the whole a clean and beautiful beach. I found the best way to enjoy it was in the shade of one of the many tiny pop up bars.

Umbrella and chairs are available from the locals at a cost however when you have small kids it's a small price to pay and cold refreshments and fruit are on sale making the shade more exciting. The ocean is fantastic for surf and body boarding with local hire available to give this art a shot. There a relative strong rifts and would recommmed caution for little ones howvever a great place to soak up the sun despite the mayhem.

Day two of arriving to Bali I decided to go turn the beach massive mistake as soon as I walked on the beach I had at least 20 people grab me pulled me down on the ground started to put a tattoo on me started to do my nails started to put all these bracelets on me meanwhile I was saying no no no they were rudely ignoring me saying money money money I'm not a rude person I was trying to say please leave me alone but they just ignored me so after spending $60 Australian money I left the beach so quickly as I was completely stressed and did not enjoy it

Everything is full of litter. and everybody tries to sell you more of it. At horrendous prices!!! You can rent surfboards but beware: the dealers losen up one fin before you go to the water. If you then lose it you have to pay them a whole new set. So check your finns! None should have any game! as whole: avoid kuta beach ;-)

This is an average beach compared with those of Thailand and the Caribbean. Every few steps your offered drinks, massages, sarongs etc. All part of the experience but after walking a good distance no thanks wears a little thin.

Not much place to swim as it is mostly a surfing beach. We were relentlessly hounded by vendors and surfing instructors that just couldn't take a hint. It was very hard to relax whilst being constantly watched and followed.

I ran it at dawn, I watched the big waves and tiny surfers do their thing, I watched the sunset and kept cool chilling with an apple flavored sheesha and still I know I will go back to repeat the above steps and won't get tired of it because there is something special about Kuta Beach in Bali that people love and I am one of them:)

Depending on which end you choose to park up and soak up all the beautiful sun, we choose to beach bum it closer to Discovery Mall, the beach was clean and inviting, water was warm and refreshing, surf was great plenty of room for leasons, its bot a swimming beach because of the endless waves so if you want to have a relaxing swim this aint your beach and prepare to be tumbled by waves, we did not get hurrased into buying anything or renting out a beach chairon this end as well

I did not like this beach at all, it was dirty and there were lots of people trying to sell you things while you tried to relax. It's a popular sport for surfers so makes swimming a bit dangerous.

Beer however is cheap at the many bean bag areas and it's nice to watch the sunset.

The beach was directly over the road from our accommodation at Kuta Bex.
All we had to do was walk out of the hotel and the beach was across the road.
It can be very hot at the beach in the day especially and mid day sun and there is very little shade unless you hire yourself an umbrella or deck chair.
It becomes busy around 5 pm with tourists and even locals when so many come to watch the sunset, chill & sit at the beach. This is a daily activity for many with sunset around 6pm.
We went to the beach about 4pm & Enjoyed a sunset and a few drinks under a shady area that we found. It was still very hot & there is not many places that you can just sit under the trees so thus why we chose this location. We sat to chill out then with one of the local beach vendors who gave us a deck chair to relax in. There is numerous vendors located everywhere along the beach selling drinks, hiring surf boards etc.
We asked for extra cold drinks and that is what we got. The drink I chose he didn't have but very quickly went and got it from one of the other vendors for me.
Drinks were cheap and we chilled out in one of the vendors deck chairs. We loved talking with the 2 Balinese guys that had sold us the drinks who were interesting & very lovely & a nice afternoon was had by us all. From speaking to the Balinese guys, they told us that Bali is changing and we even noticed in 1 year how much Bali had changed.
Sadly there is not many Aussies going there anymore and that it is mainly Russian & Asians coming in tourists. The taxi driver we had also confirmed this to us and once again this was evident at where we were staying at KutaBex and them catering in the buffet them.

The reality is that There is hawkers that come along to try to sell you various items but if you are polite to them they will move on.
CAUTION:-=The beach is black sand and can be very hot especially to walk on so make sure you have your thongs on. You can burn very quickly so make sure you slip, slop and slap. It is extremely hot in the sun & even for us that are used to a hot climate, we fun it extremely hot especially during the middle of the day.

Overall we found the Bali people to be beautiful & very gentle people but Sadly there is also a criminal element that can happen here now including at the beach so it is advisable for you to not leave anything of value especially on the beach or if you go in for a swim.

Very nice place , I was a little unsure when I went as I was told by many people and I read a lot of rewievs that kuta is full of drunk people and I'm not a big fan of this kind of environment, however I was pleasantly surprised that I was not bothered by anyone. Got to the beach and found a nice spot where I returned for all the days for my stay in kuta. There are people selling food and beer on the beach , met a lot of people from different countries , families couples and friends traveling together . Managed to find someone to drive us around to see Bali for a reasonable price without trying to cheat us. All in all I'm pleasantly surprised .

In Bali's heyday, Kuta must have been the talk of legend. Beautiful pristine beaches and a surfer's paradise. Today, the beach is filled with hawkers and touts that hound you constantly. If you go for a walk along the beach, every 30 seconds there will be talk of massages, surf lessons, fruit shakes, bracelets, etc. and the list goes on and on. Even when laying down, it's a constant barrage of hawkers waking you up. The beach is very crowded and there are many con-artists that work the beach looking to snatch a new phone, camera or whatever else they have an opportunity to. The beach is dirty and covered with trash, however, they do a good job of trying to clean it up by the following morning. It's a nice place to go for the sunset, however, as darkness appears, it gets a little shady on the streets right outside the beach, as does the town of Kuta! As for the water, there's definitely cleaner spots in Bali. Do yourself a favor and find another beach on the island. And for the record, this is my 1st ever 1 star review!

Thus area would be so much nicer if it were proper maintained. The rubbish you can find on the beach is sad and there are a lot of hecklers trying to give you massages or sell you stuff. Definitely more relaxing places a short distance away.

Good beach to swim though there are lots of waves allowing for surfing and body boarding. Surf and body boards can be rented on the beach. There are clothing stalls, stalls selling cold drinks and food stalls. We had some great food at one of the stalls which was fairly reasonably priced. Hawkers walk around selling souvenirs and cut fruit which we purchased. Not many shaded areas but occasional trees provide this.

White sand beach. Bargaining is the KEY to having a good trip. I will keep repeating that advice in my review to ensure all the readers understand what I mean.

You have an option of sitting and chilling by the beach and enjoy the waves their or you can also learn to surf. There are a lot of people who are willing to teach you how to surf. But the amount of Rupiah they ask is insane. I would Suggest very very STRONGLY that you learn the art of Bargaining. Also, all the sun beds are on a Cost which is absolutely unreasonable so the bargaining plays a very important role. In case you dont wish to pay for the sun beds, you can carry your own towels and enjoy the sun on the warm sand. But please please be beware of people offering you free seating but will try to rob you. We almost fell for it. We saved our belongings because I am good at being paranoid and when everybody is trying to make money off of you but suddenly this chap says - 'freee' means they have something else in mind. Please take care of your belongings at all times. Don't let it out of your sight even if you have to go enjoy the water. And once gain everything they are trying to sell you can be bargained at whatever cost suitable for you. They will always make money/ profit. For example the Fresh coconut water that we purchased from the beach was charged to us at 50k Indonesian Rupiah whereas the same was available at our hotel(5*) for 35k. We did not care at that time but realised only at the time of departure while checking the bills.

All in all a good experience. Must visit. Ps- bargaining and need to take care of your belongings and DO NOT trust strangers.

The perfect beach to relax and enjoy surfing for the first time. The sunset is so beautiful and their warungs make great food.

I liked this place, however i have to be fair and compared to other beaches (inside or outside Bali) this one is nothing special.
It's fun though, many surfers learning, people playing music, offering anything you could need at the beach... Like a french manicure for example...
The place is interesting. Go for a beer, surf, or whatever you want. It will be fun! I had a pretty good pizza in a small restaurant there! Good to get some decent western food (i was glad after 15days of indo food, no offence, i love it!)
I would not stay there for too long anyways (2 days more than enough), but if you fancy touristy areas, with a Mc Donalds and a Kfc, shopping streets and malls, clubs and bars and all those kind of things, you will feel like in paradise!
Indonesian Benidorm ;P

Kuta beach is bustling with locals selling everything you never knew you needed or wanted. You can grab a coke or Bintang and settle down on a kids plastic chair in the shade on a hot day and just watch the antics on the beach. It's a fun time and you'll be glad you had the experience. Even if you only do it once on your visit to Bali,

The beach was beautiful and clean. The sand was nice. The water was warm and calm. I had previously heard from many people that kuta beach isn't very nice and so I had my reservations about going there. It turns out that several of the people who told me that it wasn't nice had not actually been to this beach. They just avoided kuta beach altogether and were simply repeating what they had been hearing from others. Go check it out. Great beach if you're also looking to be close to a good nightlife scene.

We heard about this beach not so good things BUT for me it was the best beach in bali BECAUSE - nice sand , no rocks , good way to the sea , nice shops with drinks etc are close and everything was nice and clean .. if you want u can find places with surf guys and if you don't want you can find place without. We love it.

Watching the sunset with a Bintang, sitting on chairs in the sand and having a neck massage. Sellers everywhere wanting you to buy kites/knives/make-up etc. Doesn't get any better than that.

The beach is full of people selling things- sarongs, shorts, singlets, henna tattoos, manicures, massages, beer and even chairs for a fee! It's so busy and hectic- you won't get a peaceful stroll along this beach! Every few steps sees someone trying to sell you something.

On the beach is a giant turtle which is a great place to visit. At 4pm each day you can get a token for free to release a baby turtle into the sea. This depends on the turtles hatching but Aug- Nov is a good time apparently. It's a really special thing to do and a great place to learn about conservation.

It's a beach but it's pretty average. It can't compare to the beaches in Australia but it's good anyway. The only thing that made me take off a star was the fact that there were so many people following you around to make you buy and umbrella or surf lessons.

Enjoyed such a great sunset from this beach. Very popular with locals and tourists, and there are many chairs to sit and enjoy watching the sun go down, as long as you buy a drink from the owners of the chairs.

Kuta Beach was fantastic, even getting crowded. This beach is near to the hotel at Jl. Kuta, better if you stay at hotel near here.

The beach is really great for a dip and you can get a chair hire in a lovely shady spot with cold drinks (fee for service). The only thing that ruins it is the constant barrage of hawkers who just will not accept a no thank you no matter how polite you are. It is a shame and goes against the grain to be rude to them but it seems to be the only way to get through to them that you want to be left alone. The beach and ocean itself is beautiful. My tip is to learn some Indonesian to say no thank you please leave me alone today.

The water was clean and calm and thus makes it a paradise for surfers even the beginners. Beginners can learn surfing from the coaches there. Remember to bargain hard, chat and joke around with them, they are extremely friendly. Perfect place to learn surfing. Surfboard rental would be cheap if you're already an experienced surfer. For beach lovers, i would suggest other beaches in Bali as this is too crowded that we couldn't enjoy much. But the location is strategic, beachwalk, poppies lanes and legian street are just within walking distance. Great shopping and dining if you can ignore the crowd everywhere.

I only swam early in the morning before the place packed out and all the hawkers started. Water is lovely, surf looked fantastic, but there are cleaner beaches in Bali and the piles of rubbish smelt awful and attracted dogs.
Once the hawkers start you can't make it more than a few paces without being hit up to buy or rent something.
Would go back for the surf.

Kuta Beach located in the heart of Kuta is a must visit Beach. There will be lots tourist as well as local around but not to worry as the beach is really wide and big. You will surely find yourself a spot to chill.

The waves are good for surfing. The swooshing sound of the waves are amazing. Close your eyes and you could feel the relaxation.

Kuta Beach which is just side by side of Legian Beach is an awesome spot for a panoramic view.

You should at least come down to Kuta beach if you have not yet been to and see if it does suit your preferences.

In addition, just a walking distance from the beach, you will find yourself lots of shops for you to shop around as well.

Cheers !

I really excited to see Kuta beach at the night. We landing at Ngurah Rai airport Bali at 18.00 pm. We use Grab car to Rabasta hotel, its very cheap only Rp 20k. After check in hotel, we walking go to kuta beach is only 10 minute. We go to Discovery chanel , walk to behind mall and find the kuta beach. We wallk to right side of the beach, we find many people sit and play pokemon game lol. Maybe 1 hour we take alook around at the kuta and the we back to hotel.
We just spend money 500k for 4d3n to pay the hotel *3 for 2 people very cheap.

I visited Kuta beach on my first day in Bali. I wasn't too impressed as it looked like any other beach anywhere else.
The water seemed dirtier and the beach as a whole was crowded with lots of people running around, surfing and doing other activities that you would normally associate with a beach.
Due to the commercial popularity of the location, you will always be approached by vendors trying to sell you something or the other.
Overall, it's just your average beach. There are plenty of cleaner, quieter and more relaxing beaches in Bali.

Kuta beach is nice, but not quite as nice as Legian, which is just further north. This beach is quite steep to the sea and has lots of coral in places. Lots to do here with Surf Schools, sun loungers, board rentals, drinks sellers etc etc. Very close to Kuta centre too.

A very clean beach with extensive sand area. The water was the cleanist I have seen it in my 20+ years travelling to Bali. There are also well shaded areas with trees to get out of the sun. The surf was good, however the waves are generally dumping and not conducive to extended rides while surfing.

We were in Bali for my second visit and my husband and our friends first time. We were staying in Seminyak so we scootered down so the boys could experience first hand the crazy beach that is Kuta!

People coming from everywhere to sell you anything. Tourist everywhere. Bintang's everywhere.

Lovely beach with fantastic sunsets - only problem for us polite Brits is that there are far too many rude Aussies. If you like their stereotypical nature and cheap partying this is the place for you otherwise head up the coast slightly to Seminyak/Legian for a more tranquil laid back experience. The shops and stalls are slightly more expensive there but worth it in the quality of the merchandise.

The pristine coast is beautiful as the sunrises and sets, must see experience with a cold brew from the 'pop-up vendors/bars at the edge of the beach.

Nice beach but no swimming as water is mixed with black sand and loads of surfing activities.

Really nice beach, occasionally a bit dirty especially in the wet season but that's Asia for you. If you want a relaxing swim then don't bother. Great for surfing and diving through the huge waves! Very strong currents wouldn't let In experienced swimmers in there but if you are a strong swimmer you'll have a ball. Nice to sit on the beach and order the $3 bintangs but you will be hassled by locals trying to sell you all sorts. Would definitely recommend if in Bali though. Not the best but nice.

Kuta beach, Bali.
It's not what it used to be, such a beautiful place to relax and just take everything in.
Now filled with what seems to be every local trying to make a dollar of you if you're foreign.

The beach itself is quite beautiful & great place to learn how to surf. However the non stop hustling from locals is just unbearable. Every min somebody would come up and ask if we wanted ice cream/ massage/ bracelets etc. Then they would do a lap of the beach and come back to you again to offer same stuff. It was like a never ending torture!
We end up leaving after spending about 30 mins here.
The drinks and sun beds are also very overpriced comparing to other beaches around Kuta. My advise , rent a scooter and go to other beach ( like near uluwatu)

Stunning beach stretching for miles with soft sand and lots of activities and good waves if you want to learn to surf.

Had a surfing lesson which was reasonable value and the instructors were very good.

On the negative, (unless you enjoy the experience) you will be approached by many venders some repeatedly wanting to sell their wares from ice creams, coconuts, foot and back massages and nail polishers and bracelets but as long as politely decline they will move on.

The beach is separated for swimming and surfing however not a great deal of notice of the flags seemed to be taken by either swimmers or surfers but everyone seems pretty relaxed about it.

To add to that the beach is so dirty. There was crap everywhere.

As just about the only thing to do in Kuta other than drink a lot or spend ridiculous amounts of money on a taxi out of Kuta, the beach is naturally popular with locals and tourists alike. Pop up bars are dotted along the sand, meaning that one can sit in the shade instead of the hot sands as long as you can out up with dismissing hawkers every five minutes, drunk middle aged Australians, and being told "welcome to Paradise" repeatedly (as if). The bar owners have a habit of changing the beer price on every order, so watch out. Normal price should be 20-25,000 rupiah; more expensive than some bars but cheaper than most restaurants.

Other than this, the beach itself isn't too bad. The sand is a little coarse, and it is annoying that the locals think they can get away with charging you for showering it off - as well as for just using the toilet - because the tourists let them. You can pee in the opposite shopping centre, or the beach itself, for free.

The water is nice, as it stays about waist height for quite a way out past where the more adventurous surfers dwell. Watch out for surfers if swimming, though swimming is not so possible as much as jumping waves and wading is. The current is really too strong, especially when one of the frequent big waves come and you find yourself being dragged out. It is not difficult to wade back to shore though, and the lifeguards evacuate sections from swimmers when they notice an abnormally strong current.

In all, however, it is just a beach; also they only thing to do in Kuta which means any reasonable human being will get bored of it quickly unless you can afford to surf. Drink a beer or fourteen, wade in the sea, and good luck putting up with the rest.

What more can I say than sunset on Kuta beach is amazing. Its incredible how may people flock to the Kuta beach around 6PM each night to just sit down on the sand and relax whilst watching the most amazing sunset. If you're ever in Bali you need to see this at least once...its like watching a door to heaven open up and having a peak inside..

We went there on April so it wasn't too crowded and, there was space available easily. I did get one surf course, one of those that you pay only if you can get up...which everybody can, due to the size of the boards, but it was a nice activity. You can get food on the street quite cheap but, don't ever exchange currency on the small stalls at the street, you'll be ripped (I did).
Also, plenty of people selling drugs so be careful because there's death penalty for people caught with it.

When I stay at bali, I come to Kuta Beach everyday. Close with my hotel, so just need to walk. You can swim of course, and you can learn how to surf (you will find a lot of surfing teacher, and you can rent the surf board too). For someone like who can't swim, and just want to stay to enjoying the view, you can rent a place to sunbathing, around Rp 50.000 /hour ($5) you need to bargaining if you want to stay for a long time ;). You can buy beers and some drink there too. There's so many people will try to sell some stuff (just say no if you don't wan to.. If not they will coming and following you all the time), some old woman will offer you massage (but its not good, so I didn't recommended this haha)

I'm sure this was once a beautiful place now however it is the place to go to if you want to party all night and that's about it. The beach is crowded and you don't get a moment peace from the hawkers and the lady's on the mature side trying to massage various bits of your anatomy. The streets around kuta are full of much of the same. If you think it is convenient as Base bear in mind that it can take over an hour just to get out of kuta town, I'm not sure about seminyak but I know if you pick a location to stay you are better off there. Or even better stay in a different town. There are plenty of restaurants bars and shops about. And I have it on good authority from the moustached man on the side of the street that you can get anything you want (and he seems to repeatedly insist that he knows what I want.) Anyway dobt let all that put u off hey?

What a marvelous beach it was. Lot's of activities there to do. Scuba diving , paragliding, banana boat, etc. lot of tourist were there.. You can't paragliding by going there. Only thing is that they charge a lot to the foreigners. So, be aware.. Also make sure to leave your valuables at hotel...

Great yellow sand beach, clean with warm water. Chairs and umbrellas are everywhere, as is drinks service, coconut water, surf and bodyboard rental equipment... Do bargain with locals as they always tend to push the prices up at least 3x

Kuta beach is filled with tourists, shops, people, malls, stores and a lot more. Between 12-6 the waters are filled with tonnes of people which makes it almost impossible to surf without hitting nearby swimmers or other surfers. The beaches are relatively clean but the water is not the picturesque blue water that may be expected in Bali.

This is a great beach to learn how to surf since the waves get progressively bagger the fietser down the beach you go. Start close to the airport and move Along the beach when you get better.

It is also a good place to just relax, and beautiful.

I went there during the high Season and the beach wasn't too crowded at all. You can also eat local food on the strip and if you prefer Western restaurants the main Road is only 2 min away.

Finaly i would like to add that, if you are just looking to lay on the beach and relax, Gili Trawangan would be a better and more beautiful place to do that.

This is a nice beach to refresh yourself after partying in kuta. the local govt showed a great care to this beach by maintaining and not comercializing this beach. but expect a crowded place when you visit this beach at sunny day. but afterall this beach is a very long beach so you wont get too packed if you visit this place

The beach itself is lovely and a great place to learn to surf, but the hassle you will get from locals makes the whole experience painful!! You cannot walk down this beach without being asked every 30 seconds if you would like a drink/lounger/surf lesson etc. etc.! Go to a different beach on the island if you want some peace and quiet.

As I am not an outdoor guy, I prefer to have a drink and get a chill in the air on the beach. And Kuta beach can definitely offer what I am looking for.

What I did was just sitting there on a rental day bed (which is not expensive), drinking beer, and enjoying the atmosphere, the waves, the sea, the sun light and people surfing. That's awesome to me. And I always recommend this easy chilling moment to all my friends who visit Bali.

Of course, when you're in Bali you have to have a Bintang on Kuta beach. The ambience is vibrant, and the heart of tourists learning to surf in very unforgiving water, and hawkers galore. We timed at a minimum, every 30seconds someone trying to sell something, from sunglasses, ice cream, fruit, beads, massage, smokes, watches, thongs, sarongs and even a bow and arrow! At least you can get a seat under an umbrella, drink Bintang and watch the world go by.....a must do at least once

Very busy beach so loads of room to soak up some rays. Be prepared to be approached by locals selling bangles massages etc but most will not bother you too much if politely told no thank you.

We found family at kader bar to be really friendly and offered great service.

It is not the best beach, in Bali. Sometimes it is not clean, the sand is rough. Many surfers dominate the beach although the waves are not really appropriate for surfe activities.

I was not impressed. Took a glass bottom boat to see coral and fish but the water was so dirty and polluted that it was a waste of money.
The visit to Turtle island was included and that was terrible. Turtle island ought to be closed down. Nasty and dirty, with animals in very poor condition.

I would say this is a great way to start off to get familiar with your surroundings. There are lots of shopping to do. The beach is lovely. Expect to have locals come up to you selling stuff. They are not aggressive, they just make you feel bad for not buying stuff. Don't be fooled. There is a lot of touristy food, mc D, Starbucks, etc. it's very active in Kuta beach. If you love to surf this is a good spot for pencil and short board surf. The waves are short and consistent. Would come back again.

We were not staying at Kuta after many reports from friends to stay away from that area, but we did come to Kuta beach for a visit and a shop at the beach market. It appears as such a beautiful place, but the crowds and very pushy sellers put a dampener on the place. Many people told us about the bogan Australians that flock to Kuta and I must say, that is what we experienced in our two visits here.
I am so glad we did not stay in Kuta, but you need to come and judge for yourself.

I travelled here with my sister and friend back in September as we toured some of Australia first. We stayed at the 5* Grand Barong Resort in Kuta which was the heart of everything - ideal for what we wanted and needed. The beach was only 5-10minutes walk from our hotel. The sand was clean, the beach was lovely. There were a lot of surfers, sunbathers and people selling food, goods etc.
We spent the afternoon here just relaxing and watching the world go by. Its a little bit of paradise here and definitely worth visiting. I guess its ideal for surfers as there seemed to be a lot of them.
The large shopping centre was just across the road, as were bars, restaurants etc

Poor beach, unless you like sitting on chairs in crowded areas, no sun beds available, very busy area and beach is not the cleanest. Would personally not go back there. If you are in this area, go about 1km north to Legian beach, not as crowded, sunbeds available for hire with umbrella (100 rupia for 2 beds and umbrella / day), beach is also cleaner. One lovely place as you get on the beach a through the main entrance, straight on your right is Joseph icey cold beers "bar", lovely people there, hire beds and will serve you cold drinks to your bed, reasonably priced too.

I attended one of the best sunset in my life, it was so magnetic, colorful, and charmed. The beach is really big, full of surfers and local guys that were ready to welcome you, to offer a chair to watch the beach and to repose under shadow. To bring some cold drinks against to pay of course but in same time these guys didnt pay attention at all for the garbage that was everywhere. For them the trash on the beach and in the water was like it didnt exist. I think it is a meter of time the tourist to stop to visit this beautiful beach that is going to become a laystall very recently.
Out of the trash everywhere, Kuta beach is a wonderful one.

Due to visiting Bali for two weeks we visited both Kuta and Seminyak beach. Kuta beach is very busy, great for surfing and amazing for the sunset. However it does have a little down slope compared to Seminyak which is flat and a lot more quieter. Kuta beach has quite a lot of shells and pebbles, making it hard to walk on in places. Seminyak has none. In comparison both me and my family preferred Seminyak beach. However one thing that Kuta beach did offer which I highly recommend visiting is the Turtles sanctuary. This is at the beach and although it is free, they do ask for a small donation and in return you get to release a baby turtle into the sea. One word AMAZING! Both me and my 9 year old loved it.

Downside is that is't super touristic, the beach at Kuta is usually overcrowded. Lots of macho Indonesia surfer guys hang around and everybody's drinking beer. Not a relaxed atmosphere. The small roads on Bali are full of trafic, and there are always jams. Also, there's a lot of scamming going on in Bali, especially Kuta (for example money changers who cheat on you), so be very careful!

Kuta Beach is a great spot to take a dip in the ocean or lay on a sun lounge during the day but it's also a great spot to sit under the trees in the shade late in the afternoon from around 4pm, well that's when I usually go. You can just sit and enjoy a cold Bintang, Smirnoff, soft drink or whatever you choose (prices are fixed and the same from every bar so no need to bargain) from one of the many bars, enjoy the sunset and chat with the locals or get a massage, manicure or pedicure by one of the local ladies.

Some women hassle you a bit and try selling you their many wares but just be firm with them if not interested and they will soon leave you alone.

Come earlier in the day and enjoy a personalised surf lesson by one of the young surfers, it's great fun. I can recommend a local surfer, 'TORUS' or 'Dron' he sometimes goes by who is right next to the lifeguard tower in front of the Sheraton. Just ask someone around there and they will find him for you, tell him Wendy recommended him and he will look after you and even organise any tours or sites you'd like to see if you want and he's an amazing photographer that will take some beautiful pics of you at sunset to remember your holiday.

Kuta beach is full of life, free to the public where everyone can swim. However, i have not noticed any lifeguard around. It may not have the best and whitest sand but it is clean, maintained and not stony, pebbly, that could hurt our feet,but some portions along the Discovery mall are rock-strewn. We washed down and enjoyed the splash of the waves late afternoon while waiting for the sunset. It's good for surfing and other water activities. There are public shower rooms, toilet but you need to pay at least 5000 rupiah as far as i could still remember. It is a walking distance to the KUTA square and a lot more establishments like bars, restaurants, shopping malls along the Pantai road.

Lie down somewhere near the water's edeg and you stand a chance of not being beseiged with people selling stuff.

Kuta Beach is a long one. Strong currents and waves ensure ideal conditions for surfers while I as a swimmer had to take extra care not to be hit by the surfers. Some very closely passed my head.

I went in august and the place is flooded with Aussies, no offense , to expensive, to busy. Horrible expensive places to eat with bad food.There are much better beaches on Bali. Sea is to rough for swimming. Sand is not looking great, it is volcano but still. Not my thing, sorry. Skip it!

We almost didn't go to Kuta beach because every third review on TA seemed to say this was dirty and crowded. But we did because we had time to kill and were staying at walking distance from here.

Boy, are we glad we made the trip! This beach is no more crowded or dirty than any of the others in Bali (yes, including some beaches in Nusa Dua)

We didn't actually sit down on the sand or buy anything from the stalls, but walked along the sea's edge. The water had receded quite a distance away and the wet sand below was nothing like we'd seen before: glossy and smooth, like glass. Perhaps it has volcanic ash? In any case, it doesn't stick to your hands or shoes and if you pick up a handful and rub it between your palms, it feels soft and non-grainy, like a body scrub!

We went at around 5.30pm and the lighting was surreal. It was almost difficult to make out land's end.

There were quite a few surfers and even kids learning how to swim. Looks like an idyllic beach for beginners.

Definitely recommended.

Usually go here every afternoon I'm in bali to have sunset drinks. Bars set up everywhere. The beach is very busy abd you will get hassled a lot to buy things which is annoying when you just want to relax, but that's just the way it is. Becareful also when swimming as the waves can get pretty big.

Go at low tide as the waves can be aggressive. The beach offers chairs and umbrellas at a price and there are many restaurants nearby.

The beach is crowded, I'd recommend Geger beach instead, a bit far but worthy of your time.

I only visit this beach whenever I have to take someone who is new to Bali.

Be wary of the people offering goods and/or services, except for the beer which the price is basically the same at any other beach. Other goods such as clothes and cigarettes are ridiculously expensive if compared to any other markets nearby.

Don't even think about getting a massage as offered by old women at this beach, they would offer a massage for 50k, but when they are done they would say that it's 100k because 50k is only for half part of your body (leg only, or neck only).

While my hubby surfed I tried to find a spot to sit on the beach away from stalls and hawkers. Was constantly bombarded with them so agreed to a pedicure, but found that she came with two other who were trying to offer massage and foot rub at the same time. I found this disconcerting and had to ask many times for them to leave me alone. The pedicure was nothing more than a bit of a file and nail polish and then she wanted the equivalent of $25 Aus. I paid $11 and she wasn't happy insisting I go and get more from the bank. All in all not a pleasant experience.

Kuta beach in Bali, is surrounded by 3 or 4 star hotels, restos and bars and just perfect for all types of tourists.there are also small shops around and a mall fornyour convenience Whether they be backpackers, or someone who likes to stay for the weekend, or long staying visit. The beach reminds me of long beach in Calfornja, though the white sands in Kuta is a lot better. Its a fun place to be in, lots of tourists visiting, not much water sports around , since the beach is crowded with people. Kuta is a public beach, and i think for all those who are looking for affordable accommodations, this is the place to be.
Be mindful of traffic durjng the day since the roads are small and congested by motorists and cars...We visited this area to eat in Hard Rock hotel, !and just take pics along the beach. Not really fond of swimming in public...

Kuta beach is great. It can relaxing to a certain point. You can have a drink almost anywhere along the beach. But the constant hassle from locals trying to sell stuff gets annoying after the 10th person comes up trying to sell the same thing. Best to bring a town and go further down closer to the water. Less hassle.

a group of us went down to the beach and got a spot after 15 minutes of being hassled to pay for a lounger and then people walk past and continually asking you to buy stuff which gets very annoying. Other then that beach has life guards and is good fun to play about in the sea with the waves or chill out at one of the bars on the beach

Lucky we stayed at Sanur beach not Kuta.
We come to Kuta beach just for one day. And it was more then enought.
Very crowdy. Constantly some Indonesian people were coming to us and try to sell something.

The beach looks picture perfect from the fancy hotels but upon walking down to the shore you will be greeted by rubbish and I mean heaps of it tin roofing sheets,water bottles,empty coconuts,cigarette packets,heaps of weaved offerings to the gods the beaches are filthy great surf but filthy I won't swim there to much pollution and how they deal with the rubbish is to burn it on the beach.

Lots of places to eat and hang out at. When the tide is low, there are some nice natural swimming pools that form at the bottom of the cliff.

This seemed a surfers beach. There were 100s of surfers in the morning that we went. If you are going to Bali stay at this beach and try surfing at Kuta beach.
It was so mesmerising that next time i will plan and stay on the beach to learn and do surfing.

=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,272,40>===============  
Took my kids here to go surfing. As soon as you hit the beach you will be accosted by vendors. Make sure you check the board for cracks and the fins are attached. Going rate is 100,000 IDR for 4 hours. Includes a rash guard ( make sure you use it or you will be sore). If you like the boards they will see you coming a km away next time and have it all ready for you!

Stick to the red flagged areas as the undertow is strong and it's hard to get back to shore if you go outside the flags. There are lifeguards who watch and will pull you back to shore of you get stuck. If you stick closer to shore and use the waves which have already broken when you are first starting it's easier. Normal 2 hours and you will be tired first few times out. You can get instruction on the beach as well. Worth it for the first time.

Nice white sand and blue water,one of the cleanest beaches in Bali. Probably because it is mostly meant for tourists. There are a lot of "I sell you my grandmas horse with kittens" kind of people but if you're not interested of what they're selling-just ignore them. You can surf and SUP and do all sorts of water activities,just name it and there will be someone who knows someone who will give you "the best price" :) If you're looking for peace and quiet-that beach is not for you.

Spent a leisurely Sunday morning on the beach with the family before our trip to Ubud.

I never went to the beach, but have walked along it quiet a few times.
I found it quiet enjoyable, their is a lot happening and it's always buzzing with people.
I hired a lounge chair at the legian end $50,000($5aus)and it was great. You can get food, drinks, even a massage if you are game get a manicure/pedicure.
It's a good experience.

My partner and I surfed today for the first time - our instructor, Jonny, was pretty good, although we could have done with a little more instruction. He bought down the price as there was 2 of us and instead of the usual hour on the beach, hour in the sea, we had 10 mins on the beach and 50 in the sea with him, then a break before being able to practice on our own. That suited us! Fantastic day!

Why would you want to go there...

1.The beach is not that good- go across to Sanur or Nusa Dua if you want better beaches.

2. I am all for getting in to bartering and frequent Kuta, however on Kuta beach its overcrowded and I would almost go as far as calling it professional begging by some Barterers- Do Not Be Fooled as they tell jokes about how much $ they rip off tourists for some of the services and products sold.

Many locals would tell you not to buy ANYTHING on Kuta beach.

There is no reason for a family to go there.

I had visited Kuta beach four years prior and didn't have a very good experience, I found it to be over crowded and with vendors that were relentless in trying to sell me things. I decided to go back again this time and had a completely different experience!

We walked along the beach and it was much cleaner than it has been in previous years. I found that if you walk along closer to the water then the street vendors aren't as likely to hassle you as you are further away from all the little drink stores they have popped up along the beach. Also, never ask the price of anything unless you are willing to buy it as they just will not leave you alone!!

After some time we decided to sit down and have a drink with one of the locals, we met a lovely lady called Janet who was selling massages and she did a brilliant job!! Better than any massage I had gotten at the top day spas in Bali and I also got to have a good laugh with her.

I'm glad I gave Kuta beach another chance and will return on my next visit to Bali!

Kuta beach is one of the best and clean beaches in Bali. You'll get the best scenery with blue water and white shore. Waves are good for surfing. There are quite a lot of surf classes going on in beach. There is ample space for parking your vehicle.

After being to so many beaches around the world.I just say Kuata beach is unique and there is a smell of ocean n nice sea breeze that is uniquely found only in Bali.
The sand is so soft and the rays of sunset look so calm and beautiful.
It is a beach of character and the locals make a living by it.And for tourist like us,it looks so inviting to play on the beach and even do some sea sport.Or have a seafood meal by the kelong.It is not cheap,but reasonably price.

There is volunteer turtle centre in Kuta beach. Every evening (June, July and August) at around 4.30 pm they use the public as volunteers (need to register around 3.30 pm) to release the turtle hatchings on Kuta beach back into the ocean. We were given a turtle hatchling in a takeaway container. We had to name our turtle. Walk down the beach, near the water in a big line. All the volunteers released the hatchlings at the time and watch them crawl then swim away. It is a great experience to release turtle hatchlings on Kuta beach with around 300 other volunteers.

No peace if you like to just chill out as there is always someone bothering you in tying to sell you something.

Beautiful safe beach but waves can be large at different times during the day. Water temperature is great..very warm.

Kuta beach is covenient.. really close to a lot of shopping malls, restaurants, bars, etc. However Legian and Seminyak beach also feature the same benefits. We found the farther north you walked the nicer the beach became. There are lots of vendors and different 'sections' with chairs and umbrellas you can rent~ we paid $100,000 for two hours however we made no attempt at bardering so you could possible get it for less. Overall I'd reccommend just going further north to Seminyak, its quieter, cleaner and overall nicer.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,275,50>===============  
Beatiful beach with busy area's and quiet spots. The palm trees lining the beach make it look like paradise and also provide enough shade should you require some.

Do not believe the travel guides warnings about people trying to sell you things in an intrusive and annoying way. Just smile when they approach you and politely say you are not interested and they will smile back and leave you alone. They are definitely not annoying and actually very friendly if you have a small chat with them.

Be careful when swimming though, there is an extremely strong current sometimes. Lifeguards are on duty but do not regularly patrol the beach. If they start blowing their whistles and signal to get out, obey them immediately as they only do this when there is real danger. The current is not constantly there, so you can swim, just be careful when the waves become larger and more frequent.

Great sunset and beer is only a wave away. If you're firm you won't get hassled by vendors. I've never been swimming there but there is heaps of learn to surf spots. Big plus is its across the road from fast food outlets so can watch the sunset and have dinner too.

Plenty of sand but in patches also has broken coral and pebbles. Waves for surfing next to Hard Rock Hotel. Handy surf instructors galore. If you hire a board they will look after hotel key cards sunnies etc. Usual array of things to buy of course. Beaches are clean so far as I could tell.

It was a sunny day and we enjoyed strolling along the beach and watching the surfers. The problem started when we sat down on one of the chairs laid under the umbrellas along the beach. SO many people surrounded us offering shoulder massage, foot massage, foot scrub, mani, pedi, you name it they have it. They would charge exorbitantly so do bargain before you allow them to start anything on you. Mind you, they started pulling my feet to scrub and braiding my hair. I had to tell them to stop many times before I just pulled my legs back! We relented and agreed for a foot massage and back massage- what a disaster. We agreed on 150,000 rupiah which I know was overpriced for both the foot and back massage per person but decided to 'support' them after relentlessly being persuaded by them. We told them we didn't have rupiah on us and would pay by usd. We were going to pay approx usd20 for half and hour. When we were paying, we used usd1 notes and usd5 notes instead of usd10/20 notes. They started claiming that we needed to pay more for using small denominations because they get bad exchange rates with small denominations. I thought this was too much and was downright wrong.
So please do yourself a favor and just be firm and say no. Or if you'd like one, make sure you are clear about the exact price and what denominations you are paying with.

After hearing so much about how beautiful the beaches were in Bali I was a bit disappointed. The beach looked nice but the sand was not as nice as other beaches in Australia or North America.

I have travelled to many cities in Asia, and this is my least favourite. I really love other parts of Bali, but can't stand this place. It's ugly, overcrowded, repetitive and has nothing special to offer. So far, we have encountered alot of locals trying to overcharge us and feel harrassed when trying to shop.

Nice clean beach that stretches for miles. Parts have surfing areas and others just perfect for a stroll. We stayed near the airport so had a nice walk down the promenade to get to Kuta town. Sat on one of the local seats overlooking the surfers and had a few drinks. THey were attentive and friendly and drinks were reasonable. When the hagglers come they will let you alone immediately if you politely decline. If you want to buy something haggle well. I got a vest top for 50,000 when she initially wanted 250,000. Great beach and friendly people. Except the bloody chinese who have no clue how to walk in public and are oblivious to people walking against them.

This is the best place to learn to surf we found. Maybe a little more expensive, but stuff is cheap in Bali anyway. Get a lesson first ($20 - 25), the guys will take you into the water and get you started, after that just rent the board ($4 - 5/hour). Ask for Fernando, in front of the Sheraton, he's fun and a good teacher and will not rip you off. Pick your tide. An hour and half either side of high tide, the waves are dumping on the beach and it's not suitable for learners or kids. The rest of the time it's great.

If your after total relaxation with everything in reach then Kuta beach is the place to be.
With gorgeous hotels , fabulous restaurants and bars all walking distance from your beach chair.
Now the beach is being kept lovely and clean and has one of the most delicious sunsets.
Everyone ( tourists and locals alike) are happy relaxed and friendly.

Lovely beach with scenic views from the Kuta Beach Walk shopping complex from across the road. However the beach is crowded as expected as there are many hotels located nearby. Be safe when crossing the roads from the main shopping complex onto the beach side as loads of mopeds and cars weaving in and out. Be mindful of the local taxis as some can charge extortionate rates. Better you have a shop round and negotiate hard unless you have your own moped and/or car on self drive hire. If you have a car on self drive - park up in the basement of the Kuta Beach Walk car park complex that equals 5,000 IDR for the first 2 hours then 2,000 IDR for every hour thereafter. Perfect water for the surfers amongst us.

The famous Kuta beach in Bali has become too many crowd for me although it still wonderful for sunset view.

The local seller is sometimes a little bit annoying for me who like quite and piece so I can hear the ocean waves.

The night life in Kuta is a heaven since you can view many good places for drinks.

Not every beach is suitable for swimming in Bali, those pictoresque ones (not Kuta beach) often have rocky shores, stones falling over feef with high waves. Kuta beach is alright for swimming, but small corals fall over the feet quite unpleasantly, however, it could be much worse. The sand is black. Plenty restaurants nearby.

I did spent two weeks at Kuta and the beach, it has best sunsets and best waves for learn to surf. It's little bit crowded, so come early at morning if you want to have your own time without many tourists. One beer at the beach is 27 000 IDR and don't buy sarongs with more than 100 000 IDR. :)

The water was amazing but a far from relaxing experience. Constantly hassled by sellers, even after we had bought a fruit salad and were sitting on a sarong on the sand. The rubbish in the sand was everywhere and the dog poo was a bit much. Once the sellers find another customer, there are moments where the sunset is beautiful. Left after our 9 year old son found the sellers a bit much. They seemed to direct their requests to him directly even though he was sitting between 3 of us and clearly showed no interest in sunglasses!

What a shame that this beach is so dirty. The waves are great and there are many places to hire a board or get lessons but there is just so much trash along the shore that it's a bit embarrassing!
It isn't the sort of beach for sunbathing, it's hard to rent a deck chair and it just isn't the sort of spot
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,280,20>===============  
You can barely walk on the beach without stepping on trash. Most of it is coming in with the tide, but there doesn't seem to be anyone cleaning it up. There are beautiful sunsets from the beach though.

This beach had rubbish on the shore line. The beach didn't have sun lounges, only plastic outdoor chairs to rent. The waves were good for surfing.

Out the front of Ramada Bintang (best hotel in Bali) you can hire a local to drop you out at the reef. Whether it's for 1 hour or for 2, it's the best way to catch waved without getting dumped on the shore like down at Kuta beach on the wrong tide.
Waves vary from good for beginners to quite big on other days.
The water temperature is about 30degrees so you can stay out there for ages without getting cold or needing a wetsuit.
Boat drop off about 100,000 return per boat.
Board hire 50,000 for an hour.
Blackie is the local guys name.
You can even pay a little more and he'll stay out there with you (he'll just surf) and bring you in when you've had enough.

The beach by day was not that great. We were across from the mall and there were few reclining lounge vendors and those that were there did not have towels available with the chairs. There were plenty of plastic sitting chairs but really, who wants to sit up when they're at the beach?

We chose not to go buy towels to hang out on this beach. Too many pushy vendors.

We did walk to the beach one evening just before sunset and that was really cool. Hundreds and hundreds of people were there all enjoying "the violet hour" together. Great for getting some good photos!

It was during our last day in Bali that we got to visit Kuta Beach. We decided to stay a bit longer than we planned as we wanted to witness the setting of the sun on that day. The beach was crowded as always but we were lucky enough to find a place to seat and wait for the sunset. It was a mesmerizing sight (I might be bias here 'cause I love sunset more than sunrise). If you're one who loves to just linger in one place or maybe the surfing type or you like to swim...this is one of the places to be. It has lots of vendors in the area and some food stalls as well. Surfing instructors are easy to find. Tattoo artists are also visible in the area.

It was walking distance from my hotel. There's a cool sea turtle sanctuary. I just stumbled upon it, but I got to release a baby sea turtle which was pretty darn COOL!!!

The beach is very beautiful! But the only thing that i dislike where the people who are selling those items keep on pestering us to buy. It was very expensive compared to sukawati and ubud market. You can find exactly the same thing and way cheaper than what they sell there. And please don't ever try their temporary tattoos. My boyfriend and i did one each on our bodies. After a week when the colour ink starts to fade, we felt damn itchy and it turn worse till we need to consult a doctor. It took us almost a month to cure from the rashes. Overall, it's just a good place to chill and catch the sunset.

I visited this beach in July. The beach is mainly for surfers as it has high waves and the sea is quite rough. No good for swimming.

Kuta is a must if you come to Bali. Things need to maintain are public sevice such as toilet. No water but need to pay 3000 rupiahs. The seller there won't receive no from us. They keep pushing till we give up. The price for nail painting or tatto were over rate. If come erlier before noon they will give starter price but still too expensive and the did it halfheart. Be careful the price could change depand on their mood. Better say no at the beggining tough they will get mad than lost much money. Best sunset could find here you won't regret.

This beach is very VERY VERY crowded, full of people, both tourist and locals and mostly someone trying to sell you something or begging for money, you feel very harassed when you come in, and also when you are trying to enjoy the sun, it is worth a visit, but of you are not planning to surf is not worth staying, there other beaches much better, around the beach you find nice shopping mall, the hard rock cafe and a lot of spas. Be very careful of your belongings. It is a nice place to get some surfing lessons.

Its the main party centre of BALI so is full of tourist all the time; Sand is made of big granules which caused rashes on my skin. Please be alert of locals providing foot message & pedicure; they will not let u rest or enjoy until u take their service & then they cheat by overcharging or asking more after the service. It’s better to say a strong NO in the beginning only; if taking the service do fix the price in advance; Although foot message & other services are far much better if u take on Poppies Lane or Jalan Legian; they provide excellent service at a very reasonable price.

Kuta Beach is a great place to take in breathtaking sunsets and see the sea turtles released.

Kuta Beach is the start of your walking experience in the hassle and bustle between swimmers and surfers competing for the waves. It's no different to any other stretch of beach on this side of the Island. Same bars, same hawkers, in fact probably more hawkers to annoy you due to proximity to Kuta. Nice to sit back and have a cold beer watching the sunset.

When learning to surf, best to avoid high tides. Slowly progress.

We paid IDR200,000 for a 2-hour lesson, supposedly first hour with "instructor" - likely less than 1 hour, and one more hour to practise on your own - again, likely less than 1 hour because of sapping energy. I think IDR100,000 for "instructor" who is likely anyone of the locals on the beach who can ski. IDR50,000 per hour for ski rental - which is expensive. We managed to pay IDR100,000 for 2 surf boards for two hours the following day from another vendor.

It's a good beach, not the most beautiful or quiet, but it's very big, not too crowded, with good beginner surfing waves and beautiful sunsets.

There are many hawkers, but usually they're not very persistent. There is a huge number of surf board rentals and surfing teachers, and as one would expect the quality can vary a lot. I ended up being quite happy with a guy called Ramon. He was fun, spoke good English and did a great job getting us to ride some waves. His usual spot is in front of the Sheraton hotel next to the Boardwalk shopping mall.

Kuta beach is really calm compared to a lot of other beaches. I've read a lot of westerns complaining about it, and I don't think it's that bad. There seems to be more Australians that anyone on the beach, and a lot of people taking surf lessons. We walked down the beach quite a way and found it to be much nicer. The water was so nice, like a warm bath and the waves aren't as crazy as some areas of Bali. The only downside is that a lot of people are trying to sell you something, I know most people don't want to shop at the beach are even carry a lot of money, plus it's all cheap stuff like ugly bracelets.

Unfortunately there is also a lot of trash, and even some glass on the beach. It seems westerns care more about the beach then the locals, but from what I read the ocean is a place for monsters and bad stuff to the Hindus (which the Balinese are), so I doubt it matters too much.

Packed with people at every part of the beach, locals selling their wares everywhere, even the main entry points of the beach are lined with riders waiting for customers.

First impressions were this was a beautiful beach. We wanted to visit to see for ourselves what Kuta beach is like. Initially we walked along the path through the palm trees where all the locals are either trying to sell you something or offering you a "seat and a cold drink". We ended up walking from Kuta north to Seminyak along the beach. It could have been absolutely beautiful but unfortunately the washed up nappies, toothpaste tubes and various other rubbish spoilt it. It's a shame they don't employ someone to clean up the rubbish as this could really be beautiful. If you look past the rubbish it was a very nice walk.

Kuta beach is well maintained. Despite it being a tourist beach, there was no trash and the water was very clean. There are bathrooms on the beach for a small fee of 2,000 rupiah. There are nice hotels along the beach road that have good lunch and dinner menus -- you can also use the bathrooms there, along with their foot washing stations. There are a lot of locals selling small items (drinks, bracelets, etc), I advise to strictly say no every time they approach you and try not to be too nice about it, since they won't leave you alone otherwise.

This review goes along with the review I just completed for the grand inna kuta hotel. Bali in self has been given over to the mafia mentality. One person/ business controls the beverage sales up and down kuta beach so therefore you have fixed prices which means higher prices. Let's get out of the business mentality now and discuss the reason for my terrible review of kuta beach. There are far too many sales type individuals roaming the sand. There you are suntanning yourself trying to catch some rays and you are constantly bombarded with an old lady asking if you want a "massage" tithe guy selling beer,water, mixed drinks and don't forget the guy with selling those physcadelic paintings that used to hang on the walls of the hippy pads with black lights.

I will never forget the experience of walking down the boardwalk where less than 18 year old girls claw at me asking me to pay them for giving me a good massage.
I've been pretty Kurt here but my message is that this is definitely not a place where I will be spending my vacation dollars again in the future.

You can't walk a step without being harassed with people wanting to offer you a massage, surf lessons, other wares. Dogs and their pups there, probably in hopes of being sold, as it engenders emotions from westerners. Surf lessons take up most of bathing area, yeah too hectic for my liking

The beach was full of hawkers who forcibly tried to sell you ice creams, cold drinks and massage services (with both hands covered in sand). One man in particular kept talking to us, kept pressing his sailing lessons to us and we just didn't reply him in the hope he will go away soon. When we finally could not stand him and replied him "no thanks", he instantly yelled "if you speak english, why didn't you talk to me?" Wow, we do not know we must speak to him if we speak the language! After we politely turned him away, other hawkers came to us every 5 mins. The waves deemed the place nice to surf but it was quite compacted so beware somebody might accidentally hit their boards on you. And the beach was quite dirty. Having brought up in California, I'd rather spent my surfing days in Santa cruz.

We absolutely loved the beach! It was amazing. Please go the black umbrellas and green umbrellas out side of kuta playa. We met some amazing women who work on the beach. Go to ketut and Tina. You can get ice cold beers and a foot massage for no more than $10. This would almost have to be the highlight of my whole trip and we went a lot of places. Just magic and very entertaining.

I stopped at a few places on the beach for a beer but my favourite was the Simpsons bar near the big turtle. The guys there are very friendly & play really good music while your kicking back having an ice cold Bintang. It's also nice & close to toilets which is handy. I'll be going back watching the sunset plenty of times next visit.

We stay all over Bali when holidaying there and there are many good beaches but Kuta beach has a unique atmosphere and feel. The surf Is good for beginners and kids u can buy what ever U like and even get noodles delivered to your spot. I recommend to stay around beach walk shopping centre look for the Zara sign on the wall and ask for Fernandi beach spot he will look after u all day and teach anyone how to surf. Good people great spot

kuta beach has very much improved since my last visit (10 years ago). Now, it's very clean, no rubbish seen & the water is quite clear. Unfortunately, everything on Kuta beach has a price...not free..including using the public shower for rinsing...otherwise, it's very recommended.

Great to visit any time of day, especially in the evening as the sunset Is great. There are lots of people trying to sell you junk or ice creams which can be helpful sometimes but be careful to not get ripped off. A woman offered to sell me some pineapple for 50,000 rupiah and when I said no she knocked it down to 20,000. Just be wary. However some of the locals selling things are really nice people and won't bother you if you say no thank you.

If your looking for a beach to surf this seems ideal, good waves all day and surfers constantly on the water. Can hire boards from the beach for around 50-100k depending on haggling skills and about the same for a lesson. You will constantly be offered this service by the people on the beach. If the weather had been nicer I would have had one.
Not very good for swimming, quiet big waves and current was strong and the sand makes the water look black. Better swimming beaches the other side of Bali and Lombok.
The beach is massive, so loads of places to lay down. The back of he beach is lined with plastic chairs and tables so can buy drinks from the sellers. The thing that I didn't like about the beach was the constant touts trying to sell you stuff, got quiet annoying but that's just something you have to deal with in Kuta.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,289,50>===============  
Love, love, love this beach and the powdery sand. Check the tide tables before heading there though as you see different waves during different periods. We made a mistake of going once as the tide was coming in and my youngest kept getting swept under the swells, even close to shore. If you have young children, best time would be before low tide. The area nearer Hard Rock is the busiest with the most people selling stuff persistently. I head over to the area in front of Pullman hotel as it's less crowded and the sellers are not as pushy. Lots of surf schools as well along the beach and we used a local one that was really good with my young kids.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,290,30>===============  
Kuta Beach is a very popular beach in the Kuta Square area, and is approximately 8km in length. The sand is nice near the top of the beach, but towards the water, it starts to get pretty rocky! It also has a knack for sticking to you, even when you're not wet, and it can be very difficult to get off without showering (different feeling than any other sand I've felt at beaches)! The water is clean and you can swim in most of the areas, but the waves can be pretty unpredictable and I would definitely keep an eye on kids going close to the water.

The disappointing factor of this beach, is the vendors; there are so many of them! I understand people have to make a living, and if they left me alone after asking me if I want whatever they're selling (fans, towels, mats, surfing lessons, etc) and I say "no thanks" then I would be okay with them, but most don't. They can be very pushy with their product. You just have to be assertive, saying something like "I've already said no thank you. Please leave me alone."

OVERALL: The beach is pleasant, and the view is beautiful (especially during sunset), but if you don't like busy, tourist-type beaches, or venders asking you to buy their product every five minutes or so, then this beach isn't for you.

The curve of the beach makes the beach long enough to play around and swim. Look for the safe flag if you want to swim. There are free beach volleyball fields.

An hour before sunset, I rushed to the beach. Lots of people enjoy the beach by swimming, surfing, or just even sitting while drinking. Seemed all people in the city gathered to the beach.

We stayed in Nusa Dua and only ventured into Kuta to buy a collectible Hard Rock Cafe pin but were bru glad we did. We actually thought Kuta Beach was cleaner than Nusa Dua Beach. I think this is because there are a lot more people trying to sell things at Kuta Beach and maybe there are more people picking trash up? ??

There are a lot of vendors selling things at Kuta Beach but they don't really pester you and the prices for a cold beer is quite reasonable. It's a great place for surfing, lots of people offering surfing lessons at a great rate so it's perfect for beginners who want to learn how to surf.

It's crowded beach and the sands dirty but they trying to keep it clean, they have been pouring with new white sands to cover the dirty sands underneath.

Great beach for visiting for a short time - it's a long beach, which along with the high waves provides a great view. It is great for surfing or a long walk, however it is not peaceful. At sunset gets overcrowded by tourists and during the day by local vendors who are constantly harassing tourists to buy stuff. If you want to have a relaxing and peaceful beach experience do not go there. It is difficult to swim due to the high waves. I would recommend the local authorities to limit that vendors harassment on tourists, it is very annoying being chased by them and then dont just take a simple "no thanks" for an answer. I didn't find the beach dirty.

I love watching the surfers from the beach, it is usually very hot so renting an umbrella is a must. Price has to be discussed as the locals tend to ask for lots of money lowering the final price sometimes for a quarter of the initially asked. There are lots of hawkers, specially at the sunset, trying to sell all sorts of things, even manicure or pedicure, which can be very tiring and irritating. They are all lovely people thought. The sea water temperature is amazing, the beach is beautiful and the sunset stunning!

I’m sitting with grand-dad Charlie (aka OldPops) under the trees in back of Kuta Beach, drinking beers from one of the hundreds of merchants stationed along the 3km+ strip. Buy a beer or three off these guys and you are their friend for life – you get a super cold one ( in insulated stubby holder) right out of the ice-packed cooler, the plastic chair under a the trees (or closer the surf under a beach umbrella and maybe even on a sun lounge if you are beach-central or north), offers of other refreshments, optional surf craft hire and hey, these blokes can arrange surfing lessons for those needing it. Wandering hawkers offer snacks, beach-wear, wood carvings, paintings, kites, cheap smokes etc and a whole bunch of personal services like massage, manicures, hair braiding and trims – all at negotiated prices of course.
This makes for a pretty colorful scene added to by the parade of tourists.
Check the local beach boys tuning cute backpacker babes (or the babes tuning beach boys) and how about the many learn to surf schools with seemingly hundreds of students doing prep drills on the sand or falling off in the surf. OldPops who surfed from C20th mid 50’s to late 90’s contends it’s impossible to learn in one lesson but we both agree it’s a great experience in imparting how difficult surfing is, and is probably the only chance Hanni from Hamburg will ever have in getting more than 3m from the shore. And at $US25-35 a pop, a great boost to the local economy.

Back to the passing parade. Not too many Suzies from Saint Tropez despite Kuta-Legian these days having more than a few high-end hotels – thing is Suzie and her mates are mostly on sun-lounges further north.
That doesn’t dissuade wandering guys from all over Indo and further looking for those western sweet-hearts seen on the 'net in mind-busting bikinis. Better value: groups, many families, some obviously school/college based (got the same track suits) who wander the beach. Many have a stunned look as if they’d never seen the ocean – probably right if they have just flow in from Surabaya or similar.
Western sweetheart strollers? Well the beach boys already have the backpacker babe’s attention. We have the occasional high-end stroller from further up the beach. But as said, most are sprawled on the sun lounges which dominate north Kuta/Legian/South Seminyak (the beach continues north with name changes for a loooong way).
All good, all interesting stuff.

OldPops and I have been calling in here on our Bali trips since the mid-70’s - over 20 visits in 40 years. We agree the place has changed. But unlike so many returnees who bag Kuta as being not a patch on the good old days, we think it’s still a very worth-while visit – only it is DIFFERENT from the good old days.
PICTURE THE SCENE BACK IN ‘75. We are talking eye-hurting white sand (touch of grey now). In back was no traffic-clogged road, just a bunch of coconut palms behind which were rice padis/water buffalos instead of today’s insanely crowded lanes lined with accomm joints covering all budgets, restaurants, trip-booking shops, bikini and board-shorts retailers yada.
Back on the beach there were maybe 2 dozen tourists over 400m (maybe 20k over 3km+ today), mostly hippy-chicks who seemed to averse to any kind of clothing. I spent my youth pining for a hippy-chick girlfriend.
Okay, a good scene back then – but as I’ve tried to impart up page, a DIFFERENT good scene today.

‘Pops grabs a board – abt $US8/$AUD10 per hour – and heads out the back. Board choice is interesting for some-one who has surfed everything from 18 ft. balsa mals in the ‘50s thru sub-7 ft thusters of the ‘90s. A 10 ft mini-mal. Closest to what we rode mid-60’s – easy to paddle and a snack to ride providing you know how to trim the board. Which ‘Pops hasn’t forgotten. The beach boys whoop it up as this wiry old dude with the grey beard throws on all the old routines – walking the deck, reverse skeg take-offs, hanging 5 – he even gets 10 toes over the nose: something I never managed.

Like Kuta Beach, OldPops still has it after all these years.

Kuta beach is a little dirty, evidence of plastics, trash and other stuff throughout the beach.

You can do better in Bali.

You can not step onto this beach without being surrounded by women & men trying to offer massages, pedicures, manicures, ear cleaning (eww), watches, bows and arrows, paintings, etc. It never stops. It is unpleasant and not somewhere I am wanting to return to any time soon.

A nice relaxed atmosphere ( in May ). The water is really too rough for swimming but it is great to sit at a makeshift bar having a Bintang and watching the surfers. The sellers are quite pushy. The sunsets are spectacular. retirednomads.com

The bad: This beach is overrun by trash and tourists that really don't care about the beach. It is right off the main "party" area of Kuta. It is filled with many (drunk) tourists that toss their trash every which way. Super crowded. It was definitely the worst beach we went to in our 3 weeks of travel around Bali/Lombok/Gilis.

The good: It is a beach in Bali - water is very warm, sunsets are nice. They sell pretty cheap beer on the beach.

Sat at "Simpson's" for the arvo waiting for the release of baby turtles. There are many hawkers walking up and down the beach selling their stuff... mr simpson looked after us with cheap beer and has plastic shovels wct for the kids to play in the sand. If you can time the hatching of the turtles you get to release them into the surf....

Kuta unfortunately is one of those treasures that got exploited by the amount of tourist that came over the years. Its like the party towns in Spain where all the teenagers go to get drunk. So if you are in to party then do go to Kuta, if you are in for quit walks on the beach with little amount of shops then Kuta is not the place for you. Overall we had a great time in Kuta as we travelled during the day and enjoyed some cold beers in the bars at night. By the way its advisable to try to rent a car with an driver, makes life much more comfortable while staying in Kuta.

very long stretch of sand running from the discovery mall (that end the beach is not great) all the way up to and continuing past legian. Quite clean just incredibly busy and once you get past the inital line of people selling you stuff it pretty good. Loads of surfers and some big waves so be careful in the water!

We went the beach after shopping in Beachwalk shopping center. However, once we stepped on the beach there were so many people came for us asking for surfing, manipedi, souvenirs and all kinds of business making! We can't even enjoy relaxing on the beach. Different owner of the umbrella seats offered us different prices. The whole beach was totally a mess!!! My boyfriend would like to try surfing and bargained with an owner, finally the owner said 2 hours for IDR100,000 and can teach him how to play! But once he paid to him, the owner just leave him alone! The people who sell souvenirs on the beach will definitely do not let u go if u sit on the beach! The beach really needs some authorized people to control this kind of business making on the beach and bring back a clean and relaxing area!

A good beach for surfing as the waves are perfect. Especially beginners will find a good training spot in Kuta Beach. Nonetheless, higher waves also cater to the more experienced surfer. The beach itself is dirty and has people trying to sell you all kinds of things every 20m.

There are many new beach can be visit in bali, but kuta is like a legend, never dies, always call me to come back.
There is so many atraction can do here, like surfing, sunbathing, playing volleyball or football, or just lying under the umbrella and drinking coconut water.
Fyi, kuta beach is a must visit for peoples who visit bali for the first time, so you will meet so many local people here, but the beach is so wide and you can choose the spot that you think not too crowd. Usually the beach get crowd during the sunset time.
If you stay at kuta area, the best way go here is walking, because the road can be stuck and jammed especialy on weekend.
Beware to local vendol who offer everything, food, tatto, massaged etc.

Kuta beach is nice by the afternoon for some drinks and some tanning also by night to watch the sun set with a nice cocktail and your lovely lady or handsome man by your side.

We couldnt believe how fast this beach filled up as sunset approached. Lovely swimming. Enjoyed relaxing on a beach bar with a bintang. Watch out for the salespeople they are rather pushy you have to be quite firm - if you buy from one of them loads more will hang around nagging for you to purchase from them also.
The BBQ corn cobs are juicy and delicious!

The beach is filled with people from all over the world. Some do surfing and some frolicking in the sun. It is a nice beach. There are locals selling clothes, sovenirs, and instant photo taking. You need to pay for photos. Before the beach are many many shops like cafes, shopping mall, hotels, street shops. Most people are in swim wear, The weather is hot. Please drink more water and stay hydrated. Wear hats, sunglass and very light clothings.

A exact place for those who like beach. At the beach, you can get package for surfing lesson. You also can rent the surfing gadget. Please come for sunset. Make sure to bring the sunblock, sunglasses, bikini.. You can sit here all day for relaxing..
Please expect that someone will approach you to sell their stuff. Just ignore if you dont like.. Dont even make the eye-contact. I just look other direction..

Came here on our first night in Bali. It's a great place to watch the surfers and drink a cold beer whilst watching the beautiful sunset - that I will give it top marks for! However you are constantly hassled by vendors to buy anything and everything; we were there not even 2 hours and were offered; ice creams, fake Rolex watches, henna tattoos, massages, bracelets, sarongs, cornrows, fried chicken, manicures and pedicures, cigarettes, drugs and even a crossbow and arrow!! I understand they are just trying to make a living but it really does spoil the place when you just want to sit and chill, as they are so persistent!

It was lovely watching all the surfers (the waves are great and there are loads of board rentals along the beach) but I would not recommend the beach for swimming, especially for children as there is such a strong current.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,297,50>===============  
Just gorgeous. Especially at sunset. Of course there are many locals trying to sell you things but that's how they survive. Just politely say no thanks and move on. Be aware if you want to use the Toilets and Showers at Kuta beach you need to pay for them. Totally worth a visit though.

Kuta beach was as I expected it to be, I was surprised the see the level of erosion that has affected it so I believe you should put this destinations on your list because I fear that eventually to ocean will take it back and wash it away.
The water is a lovely temperature for a swim and I didn't see have rip tides every day I went, I believe it would be safe for kids to swim (however the waves break pretty hard so just keep an eye on them)
You get the usual amount of bothering as you do on the street.
People offering to braid your hair,pedicures,massage etc and man even tried to seek us a blow dart haha!!
Beers are more expensive in the beach - I paid $8AUD for 2 but I assume there is an extra charge in there from them letting you sit on their chairs

Kuta beach is always a hive of activity. I enjoy walking the beach in either direction-there is always something interesting to see or someone different to meet. The surf is consistent-great for families with older children (but too dangerous for young children).The local sellers are friendly, they can be too persistent at times but mean well & are trying to make a living. An ice-cold drink is never far away !

Wow what a day we had, 20 of us in our late 20s- early 30s. We got there early to get a gazebo but as we had no kids we probably didn't need to do that. Do go early to get a locker though as they do sell out. Gazebos probably not needed. Built up our courage slowly and had a good day, both girls and guys thoroughly enjoyed it- highly recommended.

It's been a few years since we were here and compared to other beaches in Asia, Kuta is a washout. The Seawall that has been built has taken away a lot of the beach and even then you get wet walking along the walkway

We came in low season, so the minute we stepped out onto the prisons shore we were inundated with a throng of VERY pushy hawkers pedaling their wares.

We walked along the beach and were literally harassed by locals every 3 seconds. They have propped up their stalls with surf boards and drinks/snacks along the beach and are constantly nagging you to buy something or trying to sell you a surf lesson.
It's ok if it's one of your first days on the island, but after being harassed for a few days you will get bored of it.
In the 10 minute walk, we were probably harassed by well over 50 people on the beach alone, not to mention the streets leading to the beach. I'd never go here again.

Kuta beach is a must do event in itself , there's Nothing like it in Australia . It's a beach with a mobile shopping centre, that is :get ready for the sellers / hawkers. They don't stop hounding you . They come in all shapes , sizes , genders and ages and attitudes with every trick in the selling manual to get you to buy, buy ,buy.
Somehow , try to stay polite ( their just trying to make a living) but firm ( otherwise they'll fleece you).
It's appropriate to haggle over price , they expect it, and like it ...if you eventually buy.
It's a great place to people watch and enjoy an early morning jog or a sunset beer and foot massage with friends ( or the locals of your alone) . Come to think of it , it's hard to be alone at Kuta beach so enjoy the circus /community vibe that emerges in the afternoons .
If you want to learn to surf , Kuta beach is great . Cheap lessons , warm water and gentle surf make it a good starting point.
Have a go at Kuta , something there for everyone .

been there several times, good wave to train my kids surfing. theres many spot to buy drink in here but i always choose SOMA bar, its located right in front opposites side of hard rock hotels gate. you can read the name in the back of their chair. just look for bagong in this bar

surf in this bar also cheap around $15 for 2 hours. the beer are supercooled, one i like most is they inform us the right price for bargaining everything in kuta beach..

The beach is a lot like back home near Tofino, BC, albeit MUCH warmer. So great!It also stretches as far as the eye can see. What detracts from it is that everyone, and i mean everyone, is trying to hustle. Sell, beg, offer services, over and over and over and simply won't take no for an answer. It's actually a lot of fun! For about an hour. It gets old fast.

Went to the beach for the first time and arranged surfing lessons with a local for $20 for two hours. First hour they teach me and second hour I can go and practice surfing by myself. This was amazing and I learnt to surf I was so excited!

Kuta beach is full of people trying to sell you bracelets and papers and braid your hair and also a guy selling bow and arrows and blow darts. It's hard to go there and just relax with out being swamped by people.

If you're a beginner surfer, I imagine this place is ideal! As a non-surfer, it wasn't the easiest place for a swim (the waves can be pretty intense!) but it was fun to splash about in nonetheless. I wouldn't say it's great for kids or unconfident swimmers because we certainly got knocked off our feet more than a few times by the waves - two pairs of sunglasses lost forever and more than enough sea water swallowed! But lots of fun. The beach is clean and although there are some vendors selling ice cream and so on, they are polite and don't bother you too much. We spend about 4 days of our 10 day holiday there and had a great time. :)

This is not the kind of beach that attracts me. If you like to relax on the beach, this is not the place. Close to many huge hotels, resorts, restaurants, bars, stores, malls, this beach is too noisy, and there are too many people in it. Also there are ambulant sales men bothering you all the time. It is also polluted.

Beautiful beach with warm ocean and Bintang beer served ice cold with a view.

People do want to sell you souvenirs and offer massages and pedicures all the time, but a smile and a "no thanks" keeps them at bay. Or should you wish to buy something, they make for good entertainment to beter with them and you realise how humble and respectful they are. We chose to support them.

Kuta Beach serves up a beautiful sunsets and warm oceans great surf.

The beach is not good for swimming only in the part airport side. You receive constant harassment of local traders. Beware of strong currents specially during midday.

Kuta beach is widely spread out sprawling with beach vendors selling beach chairs to laze all day on or by the hour, expect to pay about 100k rp per hour.. Or 50k rp per
chair.
There was s Bintang Beer for sale, freshly cut coconut juices, nail painting, braiding, surfing coaches for juniors and adults.
The breach has lots of beach vendors will annoy you as the walk by selling beaded, necklaces, fake tattoos, and stand there in front of your view of the water.
My tip is .. Just ignore if your not interested as they will walk in quickly.
My mistake of saying no, and them haggling me ;)

Kuta beach is lovely! They rent sun beds at 100k IDR an hour. There are many ladies who offer massages. Once you buy something from a lady the rest will start crowding you to buy their products too. Surf lessons are very cheap. There are many different companies but it would be cheapest if you just rent a board at the beach and one of the locals would teach you. They are really good themselves! Sometimes the water looks calm but then huge strong waves come out of nowhere so be on alert when swimming and swim inside the flag poles to avoid being hit by a surf board. Kuta beach is really close to many restaurants. Most of it is within walking distance so you don't need a cab.

After stumbling around Kuta doing a spot of shopping, we headed onto Kuta Beach in the late afternoon directly across from McDonalds. We were greeted by a lovely dude names Imas who offered us a seat and some drinks. We ended up spending several hours there drinking Bintangs and talking with Imas about life in Bali while watching the sun go down. Even though it is packed with tourists it is still a very calming and beautiful experience. One to remember forever. We loved it so much we went back on our last night before heading to the airport. A must see.

It's not a very perfect beach in Bali, a bit crowed. I've been to Balangan Beach once. It's wondful for surf but not suitable for a beginner. Kuta Beach is in the centre of Kuta. You are easily to find many kinds of food there and lots of bar for a drink.

Arrived along with hundreds of other people to watch the sunset from Kuta beach. Large beach area, many a beach side pop up bar, so pull up a chair, grab a cold drink and enjoy the spectacular show.

The place is nice enough but the water is not that great. Lots of rubbish in the water. There are sellers trying to get you to buys trinkets every minute. Reminds me of beaches in Mexico where cruises stops and vendors swamps you with their ware. You might want to come here early to beat the crowd.

The beach was great! Stretches as far as the eye can see. It was too hot at noon and we visited again in the evening. Not a bad decision I think! Nice breeze, not too hot, no vendors bugging you to rent their beach chair, etc, beautiful sunset and since it was low tide then, the shallow water over a large expanse of relatively flat sea bed became like a huge delightful mirror.

Kuta town is not so great though. On shopping, while you can still find street shops around, they're not really cheap, especially if compared to Thailand or Malaysia.

On food, If you like street food, Kuta's not the place. We didn't see one street food stall. It's more restaurants and some of them are really costly. The best restaurant we found in Kuta was Bamboo Corner, on the small lane (Jl Popies) beside Kutabex Beach Front Hotel. Really good value for money.

But the main thing that you have to watch out for in Kuta are the money-changers. If you need to change, go to the official looking ones (the one at the cross-roads between Jl Pantai Kuta-Jl Raya Kuta and Jl Legian near Bemo Corner was pretty decent). I'll suggest not to use any of the shady-looking ones, with money-changing desks at the back of shops. We were cheated in one of them i.e. on Jalan Melasti (between Kuta Beach and Legian Beach), coming from the beach, the second one on the right, after the Magani Hotel. (Someone has marked this as 'dishonest money-changer' on Google Maps).

They'll lure you in with a too good to be true rate. They'll ask you to exchange more money, but hand you the money in smaller denominations (50,000 Rp notes in our case). They'll give you the correct amount at first and try to confuse you with the remainder small change. When your attention is diverted, they'll remove some of the money they've given you. In our case, I counted and divided the bulk of the money I changed into 3 stacks, 2 stacks of a million Rp, and a stack of 900,000 Rp. There were 2 money-changers and they created some confusion over the balance 60,000. One of them touched the 3 stacks of money I counted briefly, but there were still 3 stacks when I pocketed it. They asked us not to take the money out as there were bad people around. I only found out that they've removed 900,000 Rp when I got back to the hotel later that night.

On 25 Dec 2016 visited Bali. The first stop was Kuta Beach. It was 11.30am, it was best to visit Kuta early before the congestions build up.

Kuta is the shopping, pubbing, clubbing, eating and merry making paradise. The heart of Bali. Many scooters moving around.

Visited Kuta Beach, there were many tourists doing sea sports and sun tanning. Lots of restaurants too. The pools of beachfront hotels occupied by mainly Caucasians enjoying the sun.

Walked to Hard Rock shop and purchased some merchandise. Was told that this street will be very packed after 3pm, the congestions can last for hours.

Nice beach filled with many activities.

I spent 6 days in Kuta and went to the beach every day. The beach was somewhat clean, however, you were approached often by vendors which at times became annoying. Nonetheless the beach was nice with a beautiful sunset! I took surf lessons through JS surf located in front of the Sheraton hotel. They are independent and not a surf school, so I received one on one lessons which was most beneficial. It was also less expensive than a surf school. I was able to stand up on my first day, but took lessons for 4 days to learn how to turn and stand up on a normal surf board instead of the beginners board. I highly recommend you take lessons through JS. Just look for the surfboard with JS on it. The instructor's name is David.

We were just enjoying the last day of our trip before heading to the airport late in the evening when we got to see Kuta Beach. What a sight and what a beach! Not prepared to swim so we decided to buy stuffs ( no swimwear near the area) to be able to take a dip. No regrets. The water is warm and safe for swimming . I suggest, though, that there is a changing and shower room for tourist like us who is in the area just to swim. In Spite of the crowd , I also did not notice a lifeguard.

Pantai Kuta is always nice! In the beginning the guys trying to sell massage, tattoos and other crap were driving me nuts. But actually we've been to Bali already 6 times and they know us. The beach is just crowded in the shade but there is enough space for everyone. I always eat there bakso and sit with the same guys as I can leave my belongings unatteneded.

Just right for people who want to relax but at the same time have some places to walk about and visit. It's not as busy as Seminyak/Legian but beach is just as fine.

Very beautiful beach. Clean and big waves make it fun to swim in the sea. Surfing is absolutely fun. Though not trained surfers were there but many were there to just enjoy the feel of surfing. Surfing and crash course on surfing is available at the beach itself, but probably they are not professional. Many hawkers do break your silent time so be aware. You talk to one and many other hawkers start to buzz around you. All together a very nice beach to have fun and swim.

I had heard that the Kuta Beach is always overcrowded but we reached there at about 7 in the evening and it was a peaceful joy. It was clean and people were chilling around sipping their beers.

This beach is really big and not the cleanest but great for surfing. I wouldn't recommend swimming as the waves are really strong and do occasionally drag you under so not ideal for smaller children.

First, i like every sea! And i liked Kuta beach. But don't stay there every day! People who work there were very greedy. To safe a lilies money you can choose chair under umbrella and pay only for drink you buy ( you can buy one bottle of the water and stay all day).

Dont get me wrong I happen to love Bali for all the cultural experiences that Bali has to offers , the people are nice and friendly , i just love it and felt goodand safe . I tried a couple classes of Surfing in Kuta beach , I purchased it from some vendors on the beach just across from my hotel , it was a blast , but the beach itself it is not apostcard perfect beach , plus it can be hard to relax because the many vendors that approach you trying to sell you something , but i didnt mind it as much , i like to help some of them .

As beautiful as the Bali beach is...the annoyance of overwhelming vendors certainly takes away from the paradise. All vendors assume you are as rich as a king/queen and will not take no for an answer. The massages that are forced upon you are quite invasive. If this does not bother you, than the kits beach is the place to be. It grew on me but if these kind people could accept "no thank you" it would be divine

Even the beach is extremely crowded, but I have so much fun here. Went there almost every afternoon, surfing till the sun goes down. This beach is extremely good for newbie surfer like me. The wave is friendly, the coach is very patient, and the price is good. 200-250 IDR for surfing lesson and 50 IDR for surfboard rent ( If u'r Indonesian) :P Dont forget to taste the grilled corn or 'jagung bakar' for 10 IDR.

Beach Boys... chair boys... "super professional surfers"... who were just not giving us to make a step without bringing our attention on them... + all this "market" sellers with a baskets full of stuff made this place for us...
And what about the prices?
Are u guys special or what?
500 meters of beach walk to Seminiak direction and all this chairs and surf rent and "teachers" are 2 times even 3 times cheaper than here....

It's still a nice spot to chill and watch the world go by. Yes it's busy, black sand and pretty filthy but you can get past this quite easily and enjoy a sunset.

With the amount of rubbish in the water seeming to be worse than 2 years ago on my last visit I could only imagine how it could have been 20-30 years ago before the heavy tourism started.

Kuta beach. Well for tourist kuta beach is very famous for surfing, relaxing and sunset. Its free. All you have to do just prepare your sun block, towel, swimsuit, may be if you want to serf you can rent surf board, chair.

In my 10 days visit to Bali, i went to Kuta beach 5 times.. Not to swim just to walk on the beach, sit on the sand and enjoy the sound of the waves.. It absolutely amazing place..
Clean beach, the vendors don't bother you at all..
Don't you ever miss it !

Love going to Simpson bar on Kuta beach. Just off the entrance bear hard rock and grand inna. Find where they rescue and hatch the turtles and you will find great service and a friendly greeting and they remember you and your drinks. Also find miss Julie here, if you don't want the hassle of bartering in the streets tell her what clothing you want and she will get it for you

Bali is Bali, and wherever you go is beautiful. It has changed a lot, and the beach vendors are not so aggressive these days, which gives you a lot more time to relax. Have a sunset drink at Bar Wayan under the umbrellas. It's just across from the Grand Istana Rama Hotel.

Loved this beach. Coming from California the water was so nice and warm. Waves good enough to learn to sail on and swim in the surf. Ok so yeah the beach sand is a bit cruddy and you'll pay 15000 ird for a soda but then you can sit on a chair and watch the sun go down. May is a bit warm so go after say 3:30 pm or so. Yea there will be a ton of folks there but just go swim surf or whatever and people watch. Free fun. Oh might I suggest you bring a kite? I saw kit flying and it looked like fun.

They say Kuta beach is great for a sunset view, they weren't wrong. It's absolutely stunning. Walking along the beach though, you should be prepared for a lot of locals to ask you if you'd like to sit under an umbrella, but a drink or learn how to surf. The water is an amazing temperature at all times and it's a great beach. We walked along it to get to Seminyak and it was fantastic with lots of bars/restaurants right on the sand. A really good time.

Beautiful beach with great surf. However, the vendors on the beach can be quite aggressive.

I have avoided going there for quite a few years. It is crowded with local sales people calling out there wares and massage etc services and hotels are built right right up to the beach. The beach itself requires constant renewal as currents and wave action constantly scours away the sand. The boardwalk tends to encourage motorcyclists to the endangerment of unsuspecting tourists

The beech is large and stunning which is great for surfing. This is where my positive experience ended. Naively, and also wanting to join in on the surfing fun, we paid a significant sum to a local to teach us how to surf, as part of the deal we would get sun loungers and a parasol.

Unfortunately the instructor we had was rude, pushy and did no teaching. Instead he just kept sending me under a wave unprepared time after time.

If this wasn't bad enough he almost yanked my partners leg off after she showed some hesitation after watching me being sucked under wave after wave.

We also later found out that the sun loungers we had paid for were only ours for an hour, I must admit however that after my ordeal I was quite keen to get off the beech asap.

To top the day off as we were leaving we saw a stray dog pooing shoreside. Very disappointing.

I went to Kuta beach during the day as well after sunset. Its a nice beach but there is no control on people littering the area.
The sand turns very dark around the shore indicating dirt, but the waves negate that effect and make for a pleasurable walk along the waterline.
Baby crabs and shells make for some tingling and keep young ones accupied.

Overall a very nice experience, though I would like to see it get cleaner.

the most famous beach in Bali. It is always crowded and surrounded with many shops and restaurants. many buyers will come to you and show to you their products and honestly there are annoying.

If you want to hire a deck chair or sit on a plastic chair with a bintang crate stool as you buy beers and yhen get hassled by every vendor on the beach this is the place to go. On our first visit I wanted to see why everyone wanted to go to Kuta 30 minutes later I couldn't wait to leave. On my 2nd visit walking along the board walk in front of my hotel I was excited to see a giant Turtle with a sign about conservation but it was covered over and empty. I want to find a restaurant where I could sit on the beach with my toes in the sand sipping a cocktail. But alas thats not what you get in Kuta. So if you are going for the beach expect to get accosted all day long by Vendors

To be honest my review is very bad due to the con man who forced us into a surfing lesson on the beach.

He gave us a quick 2 minute 'talk' on what to do then took us to the sea he completely left me behind. I was told he'd just show us a the shore front - I can't swim very well so didn't want to go in deep. My partner kept being taken under the water from the waves. At this point I decided it wasn't for me, then the 'instructor' grabbed the board which was attached to my foot and was pulling me in and under.

So overall a bad experience, I'd say book with a proper company for surfing. But also the beach wasn't very nice, very dirty - was actually saw a dog excreting on the beach!

The water was great and the waves were pretty good as well. The beach it's self is rather busy and as you walk along you'll be constantly nagged to buy something or try surfing with every provider.

Kuta beach sunsets, simply amazing and stunning. Apart from the sunsets, be prepared for people to try selling you all sorts of things, trying to give you a massage, take your picture for money and also to have their picture taken with you if you are a westerner. It will be busy, noisy and the surf can be dangerous but if you're a surfer you will love it as it gets some great waves.

Australian beaches cannot be beaten so go with an open mind and expect to be disappointed with the sand.

The beach stretches on forever and is a great place to watch the sun set. There are plenty of locals selling beer and drinks on the beach, offering plastic chairs for wearily legs. It was hot, humid and crowded - and we visited in low season!

Watch out for the toilets at the main gate. 3000r to use them and you'll be given about 4 squares of toilet paper. If your tummy is upset make sure you take in your own tissues. Toilet was filthy at 5:00 when we reluctantly paid to use the facilities so hunt down a Starbucks or equivalent for a much for sanitary experience.

The water isn't always clean. But when it is it a great place to swim.The waves are good enough for the novice surfer. Great place for. A gentle swim. Lots of seller which you can chose to ignore are barter with. Plenty of little bars set up in the shade were you can have a nice cold Bintang while you chat with other holiday makers from around the world and watch the sun set. Often if your lucky enough there will be baby turtles release by the turtle rescue . Or be like us and be luck enough to watch the 31 large turtles be release after they were rescued from poachers. All in all a very relaxing way to spend a day.

Beach nothing special. Waters warm. Waves small enough for beginner surfers, and not fun to be running the risk of being hit by one if you just want to play with the waves. For small children waves are big enough to be dangerous for them. Constantly annoyed by beach sellers. To rent 2 sunbeds and a beach umbrella we were asked 50K IDR (3.5€) per hour, which was ridiculous given that in Europe you can rent the same for 5-7€ for the whole day.

They rip you off with sunbed prices, water is not so clean, beach is noisy with busloads full of schoolkids (muslims) who make a lot of noise and want to make foto's the whole time.

This beach is super crowded with tourist and vendors. Every 5 minutes we were being approached to buy something while just trying to enjoy the beach and sunset. Worse than that, if you're a westerner in a bikini, beware! People will take pictures of you whether you know it or not as bikinis are so shocking and/or funny to them. I personally was ambushed by a group of Muslim teenage girls taking pictures with me even though I said "no". It was really unsettling. I then noticed men and even some women taking pictures and videos of all western women in bikinis without their knowledge. Maybe this won't bother you, but I find it creepy and inappropriate. The water itself is dirty, and it's not even really a pretty beach overall. It's just okay. The south Kuta beaches are 100 times better even with lots of tourists. Just go to those instead.

I liked it. Wonderful sugary soft sand to walk on. Great place to sit and watch the sunset. Early in the day was not crowded, but toward evening everyone comes to enjoy the sunset. Hawkers were not that much of a bother. Just had to tell them you would buy tomorrow and they would go away. I love to people watch and this is a great place to do that. Not much of a surf beach if you are into that. The curl is too short, but everyone seemed to be enjoying trying to hang.

Still a great place for sunset beers on the beach. Sellers have coolers along the strip with ice cold beers and some girlie drinks with chairs. But the kuta banjar have taken away the food from the beach and it's hard to get a park for motorbikes an even harder for cars.

My initial stay in Kuta beach was supposed to be 4 nights but turned into 14 because of airport closures, due to volcanic ash. We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel, so we were beachfront basically. I am very much a beach gal and have been to many around the world. Kuta was OK, but very crowded and on the dirty side honestly. You can't walk on the beach without locals trying to sell you something or another. It got kind of annoying. It is a great beach for beginner surfers. I had been surfing less than a handful of times, so this beach allowed be to get some practice in without getting killed by mega waves. The sunsets on the beach are pretty fantastic too - probably its best quality. The area has plenty of restaurants, shops, nightlife, and touring companies. Overall, we enjoyed our stay here, but took multiple day trips around Bali to see more of the beautiful Island. Kuta Beach is super close to the airport, so you might want to just check it out if you're staying elsewhere on the island.

The waves looked good enough for surfing (about 4-6's not too much whitewash) but I didn't surf on this trip. For hanging out on the beach, it isn't great. The water is clean and the beach is clean, but there's no shade from trees. If you're used to nicer looking beaches with natural shade and white sand, this isn't very pretty. Plus, the vendors are super annoying and actually won't go away unless you're a little forceful with them. A polite, no thank you, will not get them to leave. I had to tell the ladies touching my hair, trying to braid it - don't touch me, go away. I had to tell the guy trying to pen tattoo my arm to just go away, but he didn't for over 15 minutes. They won't leave and keep trying to convince you to buy their crap. Later, I returned to get some sunset photos, and after trying to relax with one Bintang to watch the sunset, I left.

Kuta beach is not all its cracked up to be. The sand is a dirty brown colour & if you go for an early morning walk it is often littered with rubbish. If you want to rest, there is no hope, you are hassled heaps by people selling watches, sunglasses, kites, jewellery & others offering massages or manicures it's annoying as hell. Kuta beach you can buy everything from Bintang to hand painted tattoos. Worth a visit but don't plan your whole holiday, if you expect to lie & relax on Kuta beach won't happen.

Not many places you can get different sizes of waves you can ride on. Never surf before but can't resist the inviting waves roaring in. Each time I jumped on the surf board, the high waves pulled me under. To beat the waves, end up getting lessons from local. Surprisingly it costed 45,000 rupees i.e. $45 for a lesson. So enjoy while you can, you get a nice tan too as bonus.

Great beach for surfers right infont of Hard Rock Cafe and Beachwalk Shopping Mall. A place to visit in Bali!

Why anyone would willingly book a vacation here is beyond me. The amount of harassment that goes on at the beach is insane. Right off the beach you also have the guys with the dehydrated horses ready to pass out offering people rides. The guys on the beach assume everyone is an Aussie and hassle you by attempting an Aussie accent and calling you "mate". All around an awful experience and definitely not a good place to chill out.

Kuta Beach is the first glimpse of sun, sand and surf for many Bali vacationers. It's close to the airport, nearby bars, hotels, and clubs. The waves are small and forgiving for beginner surfers. This beach is often dirty from all the nighttime parties and events that happen on the sands. It reminds me of Patong beach in Phuket, Thailand. There are plenty of better beaches out there, but it's a good first beach to visit in Bali.

Nice clean sands and clear blue sea relaxed atmosphere if you want that or lively if you want to surf or bodyboard cold beers and drinks available you have to haggle for the best price on the beds per hour we managed to get 2 hours for 2 of us for 50000 idr so about £3 loads of lucky lucky men selling things or local women offering massages and stuff but really nice ☀️

Try Jimmy's Bar in front of the turtle structure he is a fun loving guy who will look after you with drinks. Jeki's Bar further down outside the Kuta Seaview Hotel is also a great spot to hang out and share a drink with the locals or your friends. Remember that nobody in Bali is your friend if they are a local, they are all there to make a living. You pay they do, this is how it works. You can sometimes be too generous and they will take advantage of this.

At Kuta Beach, we can collect seashells, go surfing, play body board, making sand castles, and splashing water. One of my favorites are going surfing. When you are trying to stand up, you have to have a great balance to balance on the surfing board. I really love to go surfing. The more deeper you go, the bigger the waves will get. At my first try, I barely cannot stand up. But then I can get the hang of it. I really love Kuta Beach.

this beach can only be seen in movies, dreams or in kuta, Bali.
the most beautiful view I've ever seen, very soft sand and the tides of the ocean , it was very charming and free, you can buy beverages with high prices on the beach , you have to buy one to sit on chairs there, a lot of restaurants close to the beach, go for sunset, and swim like there's no tomorrow .

If you have small kids with you who like to couch everything, this is not the place to go. Every two metres there is something new for sale, jewellery, sarongs, scalves, drinks, henna tattoos, it's all there. I like to go down to the beach to one of the drinks salesmen, he will get you a chair, a nice cold drink and protect you from the others who try to bother your serenity in his area. The beach it's self is not outstanding, but I've been to worse. The locals try to keep it clean, but with so many tourists and waves that bring in even more rubbish it is hard for them to keep the beach 100% clean all the time. Over all I like it!

Beautiful beach however it is an utter shame that the shoreline is littered with trash and the water is a bit dirty looking.

It is hard to take in the tranquility of this location as every 30 seconds you are being hassled by a beach vendor. I can get over that though as they only mean to make a living. We caved and had a few beers on the beach at one of the stalls and I must admit it was a pleasant experience.

This beach is the best for beautiful sunsets. There are vendors selling drinks and you can sit on a chair and enjoy the views.

Visiting this beach was an experience but be aware of the older ladies (and men) trying to sell you anything they can. As I sat on the ground to get some henna done, my friend and I have about 8 ladies massaging us and trying to sell us manicures, sarongs, jewelry etc. They will just start massaging you and tell you its for free, but it is not. A firm "NO" is all they understand, so be careful.

too much tourism has spoiled the beach completely. Plastic is littered everywhere and beer bottles and plastic bottles are plenty here and there. Waves are low maybe because of the season when i went but not at all ideal for surfing. Most annoying are the balinese people on the beach. every two minutes somebody will come to sell clothes, beer, massage and what not.. it will totally spoil your mood of enjoying the beach

Kuta Beach is a must in Bali. Although is one of the most crowded and not one of the cleanest, this beach offers an amazing sunset view over - usually - big waves.

Kuta is located in the southern part of Bali. It is the busiest beach in Bali. There are many restaurants and bars along the beach. also, there are numerous shops (mostly amazing street shops where you can get good bargains) - do bargain, they usually quote twice the price. the beach is good and free for public. you can also get a good back massage for a good price. also, the beach is good for surfing. you will find many surfers and if you look around you might find people willing to give surfing lessons! although i dint manage learning, it was fun trying

Beaches around the world are all good well the ones i have visited. Hawkers are a bit annoying but u get used to them if u go to same spot all the time they start to leave u alone a bit. Sunsets are awsome. I set of a few lanters at dusk and was amasing to see. A little bit of rubish left on beach by tourists but bot as bad as it once was

The water is rough and more suited for watersports (like surfing) than swimming. If you are swimming please swim between the yellow - red flags because the current is strong.

Everything on this beach is paid for, so negotiate a good price. If you want to rent a chair + umbrella, you can rent it by the hour or by the day.

Be prepared that you will be harassed by vendors every 3 minutes. You will be asked if you want a surfing lesson, massage, buy a sarong/hat/coconut/icecream.

There shouldn't be anybody complaining about the vendors along the beach all day every day, as everyone should know that if they wanted a quiet beach experience, then you wouldn't go to Bali, or at least not Kuta beach.

I personally loved the new experience of the beach here, having been to quiet beaches in places like Rarotonga, & busier beaches where nobody in general approaches you for anything, like the Gold Coast.

It's a different experience and if you have the right attitude, then instead of just feeling pestered by everybody, you can just feel popular and happy the locals want to do things for you etc, esp when everything is so cheap anyway.

I ran along the beach every morning and would have people see me running and walk over to be close as I pass and offer me bow and arrows, drinks, massages, transport etc. a polite confident 'no thanks' with a smile was all that was needed.

I think it's wonderful how you can be sitting relaxing on Kuta beach, with a local sitting behind you under the trees, who brings you cold drinks all day. That's a unique experience for me.

One amazing thing for me was after sitting in a taxi for almost an hour in traffic to get to the bar 'Potatohead' in Seminyak, days later I found I could have just walked down the beach from Kuta to Potatohead, in approx 30-40mins, after jogging it in 20mins.

And as busy as the beach is, you can still easily have a nice romantic walk along it, while you pass all the amazing beachside eateries and select one for a nice meal.

I also used the beach allot as a way of avoiding the majority of street vendors, when walking from one part of Kuta to another, and also neighboring areas.

My daughter and I were staying in Kuta and wanted to enjoy the beach there. The beach itself is long and mostly clean. We just wanted to go for a long walk in our barefeet and enjoy dipping our toes in the ocean. However we were approached every five seconds by someone trying to sell us surf lessons, drinks, massages, sunglasses, trinkets etc . After an hour we got so fed up with having to repeatedly say 'sorry no not interested' that we went back to our hotel and didn't go to the beach again on our holiday. I know these people are just trying to make a living but its a shame because it stopped us being able to enjoy Kuta beach.

A long beach where many people can spread out, so it doesn't feel too crowded. A nice surf break in which the boys in the little boats take out surfers and others for a boat ride to the break, for a good price and with a smile!
It needs cleaners to clean up the plastic in the water as well as off the sand, as this was a big problem and really detracted from the beauty of the beach. The ideal is that people should not drop plastic in the first place, but until then, picking it up is the only way to keep the beach clean.

Kuta beach though clean does not have the atmosphere it used to have in past years. There used to be little beach kiosks that served "Bloody Cold Beer" cheap and full of bar tenders that could spin a tail or listen to your stories.

Granted you had to deal with hawkers but your gear was safe while you swam, you had the true bali experience in the surf and its was just tropical atmosphere abundant.

Now there are stabbings, gear thefts and a general feeling of desperation as the hikers start to hunt customers..so sad it has come so far and its declining rapidly.

Great beach, clean warm water, large grainy sand, good surf, crowded and busy. As soon as we stepped onto the sand we were inundated with people selling stuff. I compared it our Australian beaches with fish and chips and seagulls. As soon as one gets a chip your surrounded by more wanting the same. Bangles, necklaces, bows and arrows, blow darts, massages, pedicures, ice creams, drinks. Over and over again as we walked along the beach. Plenty of opportunity to learn how to surf from local experts exist too.

We visited Kuta Beach one cloudy afternoon when the tide was out. The black lava sand and the grey clouds made for a non-swimming feeling. The beach is, as said, prone to a large difference in the tide. So when the tide is out the beach is quite wide, but when the tide is in the beach is rather narrow and will be quite occupied. There also seemed to be many activities going on and we did feel that it we wouldn't have appreciated a longer stay there. There were a lot of waves, so it must have been a great place for surfing, actually there seemed to have been some sort of surfing tournament when we arrived there.
As beaches go, it isn't worth a detour. As a whole, beaches on Bali were a large disappointment.

It was only a 10 minute walk from where we stayed but when we got there we were shocked at how poorly it has been taken care of. There was garbage every where and so many annoying hecklers that won't leave you alone while your trying to enjoy some beach time.

If you are looking for a place to surf and to learn it, Kuta beach is the right place to go. You will find plenty of surf instructors in this area and theres a good chance to catch good waves. The beach is pretty crowded but you can also swim there and see families around (even if you can see red flags all around and signs prohibiting it)
However if you are traveling with your kids I would look for some other place to go.

Busy beach with beautiful sunsets and sunrise, however the clutter and garbage leave any traveller sad for our world. Impossible to walk to the water without stepping in garbage and bombarded by garbage in the water.

The very word Bali often conjures up images of exotic sun drenched beaches fringed by palms lazily swaying in the breeze. Travellers beware, the aforementioned imagery does not describe Kuta Beach. Kuta does offer wide sections of beach and reasonable waves for splashing; however, the sand is not white, in fact it's peppered with a medley of trash, and the waves seem embarrassingly small for any surfers worth their salt. Kuta is a nice place to submit to the sun and pick up a tan, as long as you are prepared to deal with an onslaught of vendors offering an endless array of trinkets all while you try to relax.

When in kuta its a must to visit the beach. Tons of hawkers offering trinkets, massages and drinks. Lots of plastic chairs to sit in and have an ice cold bintang from the private vendors. Definitely not the cleanest but if people didn't drop there rubbish it would be much better. They even have a tractor sweeping the sand early each day to try and help.

The beach is of black sand, or maybe it is the petroleum pollution that give the color. It is only beautiful in pictures and from afar at high tide. At sunset, it is always low tide, and the black muddy bottom of the beach is quite unattractive. There are lots of floating garbage, and seaweed. The best thing was ripe durians being sold from the back of pick-up trucks at 3 USD a piece, and the many garbage cans along the boardwalk.

However the beach is not well maintain, very dirty and full of mobil 'vendor' selling goods and souvenirs (they are not just selling but following you till you buy something from them) which can ruined your expectations. Kuta is not the beach that you can relax.

Nice enough beach and nice sunsets but it could be a little cleaner. Not the most beautiful beach I have been to. They do try to clean it up as I saw a tractor in the morning racking up the trash. You get hasseled a fair bit by hawkers which is annoying after a few hours but they are trying to make a living. The ones which upset me the most was the ones with the babies and little kids. More than one guy will try to rent you a beach lounger and umbrella. Negotate a price and enjoy the beach. The guy will bring you cold beer as often as you like. They come around and move the umbrella as the sun moves. A few stray dogs wander around in the morning.

Kuta beach is lovely at sunset. Great little beach bars with supper friendly people. Heaps of sellers for massage etc. Great if you want a surf lesson. My daughter had one for $15 and loved it. The guy really looked after her and everytime we saw him again he remembered her name which she thought was great. We loved it lots of friendly balanese people.

This is a nice beach to relax and have a swim at. Be prepared to get hassled by all the hawkers roaming the beach, most of the time the prices are above what you can buy the items for in local shops so do your reseach before buying. A great beach for beginner surf lessons and sometimes higher grades when the surf is up.

I liked this beach though I've only been here to stroll around. The beach is very large and busy, many groups of people, done playing football. Nice if you're looking for some life. Very relaxed and closed to a big mall if you fancy some shopping and especially air conditioning :) from here you can easily walk to city centre where the nightlife happens

Nice enough beach, fronted by a variety of local type bars, beach clubs and smart hotels. Something to suit all pockets as far as I could see.

It seems clean enough although there are lots of dogs (no collars but harmless) wandering who are presumably not carrying bags to take their mess home with them.

Decent surf on our visits, some lifeguards, and places where you can hire sunbeds, surfboards etc.

If you don't mind over crowded beaches, Kuta beach is great if your in the area and don't feel like venturing out too far of Kuta / Legian. I would recommend getting here either early in the morning or later in the afternoon to navigate the heat, but otherwise a decent beach to relax at and go for a swim amongst the sea of tourists (pardon the pun). There are lots of tour operators and learn to surf classes, as well as food and drink stalls that you can refuel as well for a slightly inflated price.

It is a big, beautiful beach with great sand and great surfing. Being very popular, it can get crowded at times. If that's not for you, all you have to do is walk along the surf towards Legion until you find a quieter spot to hang out.

Kuta beach has everything other beaches have (opportunities to walk, run, bask in the sun etc etc) but has one big advantage - the wonderful sunsets.

Head down there as dusk arrives and you'll be greeted by countless pop up bars offering you ice cold Bintang's for 25k. They provide you chairs and a crate for a table. We just sat in silence and watched the colours of the sunset constantly change - fabulous!

We went for many long walks along it and you discover new, interesting things each time. You won't go short of a massage if you want one either!!

I like to see Kuta Beach when it will be sunset. I will wait for one to two hours before sunset, and taking many pictures from the beginning of the sunset until it will be red velvet or purple color. The sunset around Kuta or around Bali a little bit different from any other places in Indonesia. I can experience the purple silhouette will spread from the back side of the sun, just like long strip purple around the sunset. I love to see the purple silhouette again and again.

Never have I seen a beach that popular yet so dirty, it's literally filled with garbage, paper wrappings, and domestic waste. The beach is so crowded that you may need to tip toe around the people especially during the sunset hour, not enjoyable even the slightest! I suggest to go to the neighboring Legian or Seminyak beaches which are cleaner and have calmer surroundings.

My friend once referred to Kuta as the surf slum of the world. It has it all within a 30 minute drive, world class surf, beautiful beaches, thousands of restaurants, shopping malls, and nightclubs that party all night.

If your young or young and heart and like energy, kuta will appeal to you. If you want peace and quiet, go to a nearby island.

Kuta beach is a good black sand beach. Beach is good to walk because sand is wet n comfortable to walk on. You can enjoy little wave also but you have to go little inside.

Absolutely feel the air of festivity all day on Bali. The tapestry of Balinese Architecture coupled with modern amenities surrounded by ancient Hindu customs, the smell of fragrant flowers and sarong clad women doing the daily prayer offerings, it was indeed a place to get immersed in the pursuit of your inner peace and happiness. The cascading water features of the hotels and the green foliage of it's landscaping and smells of burning incense further ignites ones senses and stills ones mind. The beach is expansively voluptuous, the sea welcoming, the gentle lapping waves enticing one to its warm embrace. The temples around the islands with their ancient folklore mesmerises all who partake in its rituals. Its flowing countryside is dotted with idol statues of every living god and living things of the world, carved expertly by the skilled hands of Bali's artisan populace with venerated patience and loving touch culminating in a work of art so pulsating with vibrations of love. A must visit? For sure!!

Great to watch sunset, lots of accomodation around and places to get cocktails. Of course, this is kuta so it's very "wersternised" as opposed to other cities in bali. I think ending your stay in kuta on the beach can be a good transition before flying back home : it brings you back to something you're accustomed to experience in big european cities.

The most well-known beach in Bali, been passing the road in front of the beach since 2001. The beach is remain the same as the first time I got there. The difference will be there are more buildings across the street of the beach, and also the tall cement fence on the side of the beach. Previously we can see the beach from the street due to the fence is about 1 meter tall (I think), and now is about 2.5 meter tall (I think). so now you cannot easily see the beach from the street. However it still a good place to visit to enjoy "not so big wave" beach.

If you don't mind being approached every 5 minutes by someone offering to teach you how to surf or sell you something and don't mind swimming and walking amongst trash then this is the place for you! It once would have been an amazing beach but it just breaks my heart to see how people have treated this area. It is disgusting. I hope that one day these people come to their senses and clean up this what would have been an absolutely stunning beach.

The waves are small and roll straight at the beachfront, which makes the conditions as easy as it gets for beginner surfers. You can rent a surfboard for very little money from local guys hanging out at the beach. The beach itself is ok and there isn't too much trash laying around in the sand. Locals are constantly coming up to you trying to sell something but they are very polite.

Bali is a fantastic place, the people are great and the beaches are wonderful. It's a great experience spending a couple of hours on the beach. You find a spot and book your sun beds- have a bit of a haggle on the already reasonable price, they set them up for you with an umbrella and you can buy drinks from them which they deliver to your sunbed. What a service! Then the traders come along trying to sell their wares: sunglasses, hats, jewellery, selfie sticks, wooden carvings, sarongs and even manicure and pedicures. The trick is - don't look unless you want to buy as that just gives false hope to the seller. Just say no and have a bit of a joke with them, they are so friendly. If you are interested - let them show you their wares and have a bit of a haggle. Oh and while you are there, don't forget to go in the ocean- after all it's as warm as bath water. Enjoy.

Kuta beach is the best place for people who looking for surfing lessons where you can find the best high waves. Ossydessy is the place that teaches me how to surf and balance my self on the surfing board as first time in my life. It is really great experience. In Kuta beach also you can relax and so many local bars can also provides soft drinks or beer with private umbrella and wooden sofa to protect you from the sun radiation during the hot seasons. It is suitable for couples. friends and family too. I strongly recommend this place for all travelers who never visited this place.

The beach itself is long, white sand and clear water, but the beach och water was full if rubbish that were washt up on shore.

Positives: lots happening, cold Bintangs on the beach, fantastic food stalls, we had the Satays and coconuts, leads on to some very good hotels with excellent restaurants. One day when we were there a Hindu funeral was in progress complete with cremation on the beach.
Negatives: Pollution with lots of plastic bottles etc. the locals tend to put a lot of effort into keeping the streets and walkways clean but a lot of debris must wash up on the beach. The hawker scan be a bit of a pest at times.

We walk along the beach most days we stay in Bali starting at the Temple in Seminyak heading toward Kuta. Each day going a little further. On this day we have walked 5km to Kuta (using a sat nav on our phone). After passing the Pullman Hotel we noticed the beach getting progressively more dirty, to the point we could not walk through the amount of rubbish so we turned back. The Seminyak end of the beach is spotless in comparison. Someone needs to take responsibility for this end of the beach as it will do nothing to attract tourists.

We had an experience of a life time when we were at Kuta Beach, Bali during the recent Nyepi Celebration. All around and along the main streets of Kuta on the night before was buzzing with the street parade of Ogor Ogor, underworld devilish figures which ended up with the figures being placed on stands right on the beach front of Kuta beach. Lots of figures on display. The next day was of total silence but we had loads to do at the Discovery Kartika Hotel as they had organized games for their guess. The day after was when there were loads of visitors to Kuta beach as they had put up food, goods and games stalls and people were just having fun. There were loads of things to do and a lot of photo taking done. All in all Kuta is the place to be at when you want to experience a Nyepi celebration. Highly recommended.

Even on a warm day the walk down to the beach from our hotel, Risata, to the Didcovery Mall is lovely.

We visited Kuta beach last year and this year, but we have to say it isn't worth the effort to even visit. Firstly, the beach is disgusting with rubbish. The sea water is dirty, then there's the never ending number of aggressive beggars who literally block your path whilst walking along. They literally drop out of nowhere and the notice just about everything on you.
In the end, we gave them 10,000 rupiah just to leave us alone, but then all the others with their children expect you to give them money.
Take our advice and ignore a trip to Kuta beach. You've been informed, but if you don't believe us, you certainly will if you do go there!

Kuta Beach is a paradise for people who enjoy a good walk with lots of interesting sites along the way. We have been walking here for 20 years and although there are new hotels and the volume of traffic on the beach has increased, the size of the area absorbs the people adequately. Bali is definitely made richer by watching the sunset from Kuta Beach.

The beach here is a long beach and there is seating which you pay for. The sand is a grayish color and it doesn't resemble photos posted. The sand is dirty with food scraps and litter and looking out to sea is reasonable but I have been to far better beaches in many destinations and this would not rate highly for a beach I would say if you were going buy drop in to have a look ut if you were going out of your way to get here, dont bother. It was worth a visit. If you didn't go here at all you wouldn't of missed much.
Aussie beaches are far better, nothings special about Kuta Beach.

This place is not crowded compared to the other side of Kuta Beach near Jl Pantai Kuta. This is located behind Discovery Mall. One can grab any food or drinks takeaway (to go) and sit on the steps or at the side walk to enjoy watching the sun goes down around 6.15pm. Of course there are people selling items like silver rings,friendship bands to medicated oils. If you do not want to buy anything from them,just say no nicely to them. Of course,they are nice people.

Kuta is a beach and resort area in the south of the island of Bali, Indonesia. One of Bali's first tourist developments, it's best known for its Indian Ocean surfing and party-centric atmosphere. Kuta's long, consistent waves make it a popular surf spot, particularly for beginners, and plenty of outfitters offer board rentals and surf lessons.

Kuta beach is beautiful an d long being able to walk for miles and miles. You walk from Kuta to Legian, Seminyak and then Canggui. The beach itself is rather dirty littered in rubbish from not only locals but tourists alike who drop rubbish any where. There are efforts by some resorts to sweep up the rubbish off the beach each day. Care needs to be taken not to stand on broken glass that pokes out of he sand. In having said the above there is no better way to spend a couple of hours walking the beach each morning. You will have hagglers come up to you to sell watches, sarong, hats or sunglasses and most are Friday and will leave you alone if you tell the, you are not interested. Swimming between the flags is allowed but beware the water is not the cleanest I have ever seen by any sense of the imagination. Black sand rolled with brown water in parts does not tend to be appealing to me. Many people learn to surf here as the waves when the wind is not too blowy are small and good for learners.

Good beach, good sand, very pushy locals selling anything and everything. Surfers seemed to have good waves and we enjoyed hanging out on the beach; however, I lost count of how many times a local asked to sell me surfing lessons, a beachside table/chair/umbrella, or random items.

One thing you can count on at Kuta is good waves. Sometimes big, sometimes small, but there is almost always some surf. However, on this trip (our third to Bali) we did not go into the water for the final three days! There was so much garbage it was disgusting. We used to live in Rio so we know a bit about polluted beaches. The police, to their credit, were forcing the local vendors to help clean the beach as there was a wide carpet of rubbish from the water up the beach. We were told this all depends on the wind, but it is clear someone is dumping massive amounts of trash into the sea nearby. It is amazing that in this day and age people do not see that the beach is the lifeblood of the area and that they should take better care of it. This is sad.

Made the mistake of heading to Kuta beach for a drink and a sit-down after some shopping in Poppies. As soon as we ( 4 of us) got seats, no less than 12 women surrounded us and grabbed at our hands, feet and ears, touching us and demanding we get a manicure/pedicure/buy their sarongs etc. Would not take "no" for an answer. After about 5 mins of arguing we tried to get up and leave, they demanded money for the feet cleaning and ear cleanings that we had not agreed to but had been assaulted with anyway. One of the girls in our group was in tears and very shaken up by the experience.
Should have researched this better, lesson learnt. DO NOT try to chill on Kuta beach! Up toward Seminyak the vendors are much less pushy.

We were hoping to catch some waves and surf in Kuta, but when we arrived on the beach it was overcrowded with people and trash piled on the beach. The beach is lined at the brim with vendors renting soft top surf boards and selling crap.There are so many beautiful destinations in Indonesia and on Bali. Don't waste your time in Kuta there is so much more to See!

The warm water and the nice waves are a treat. I went out where no one was surfing because I did not want to be in the way of an amateur surfer. The sandy bottom makes riding the swells and body surfing very enjoyable. Be sure to dive under waves that break in front of you, or you'll be tossed around in the churning froth.

Some people found it overrated. It could be. But yeah if you are in Kuta, maybe won't be too wrong to visit it once just to know Kuta in short? Local sellers, tanned guys offered surf lesson, small food and drink stalls are expected. It's alright, don't be panic. If you say a big sure "no" at the first time and try to not look closely to what they offered, they won't insist you more. Enjoy it. You can walk all along the beach pass the hardrock cafe to the famous beachwalk mall or stop for a coffee in a cafe outside. The waves is good for beginner surfer or anyone who never surf before. If you could pass this one, it's mean you can enjoy the rest of Bali craziness haha.. good luck!

Kuta beach is so different from Ubud. Kuta is filled of shops all trying to sell you the same stuff. The traffic can drive you insane and the jam seems endless. There are too many tourists and the place is too crowded. The good thing are it is near the airport and beach.

It is an enjoyable walk early in the morning but that's about all. If you think that you will be left alone just to walk, you are in for a big surprise. You will get approached to buy anything including surveys which I advise, avoid as you will be rung up at your Hotel or Villa nearly every day. Depending on where your walk starts is to how much you will get pestered. All in all, if you can put up with being stopped every so often, it's okay but it's something I couldn't put up with every day but some people think it's just part of Bali.

It has been almost 30 years since I visited Bali. To be honest I was never a great fan - I preferred Phuket, or at least I did back then. We stayed 2 nights in a mid-range hotel near the Discovery Mall and hated everything about it. The main road - the one from the airport was just an endless stream of taxis and motorbikes and touts with a narrow pavement often partially blocked by parked motorbikes. There are also no decent restaurants on this strip and, judging by the beer bell-mark, expensive too. (We have now moved to Sanur which seems to be much nicer with nicer and cheaper restaurants) We re-visited one of my old favourites, Poppies Restaurant, but nobody seemed to know of its existence - to everyone "Poppies" is just the name given to 2 narrow motorbike-clogged lanes whereas, in reality the lanes are named after Poppies restaurant and hotels. I remember Poppies as being almost on its own and on leaving it you were on the beach, but now it's just lost in a horrible lane amongst countless other places and it's nothing to get excited about.

Be careful of cheating money-changers - you know which ones cheat because they offer about 5% more and they work out of tiny boxes hidden away down side-lanes.

The other thing I don't like about Bali - and most other Asian countries (Cambodia excepted) - is the absurdly high price of wine and this is compounded by a very poor selection. At least in Singapore you can get some decent wines, albeit at a price.

Arriving in Bali was looking forward to seeing the legendary kuta beach. A little disappointed when seeing the state of the beach. Sad to see how much garbage and debris getting washed up to shore. But could see that they were working on cleaning it up. If you are looking for a relaxing day at the beach do not go here. Constantly being confronted by people selling surfing lessons, beers, sunglasses etc. not many places to chill that haven't been taken over by pop up umbrellas and chairs selling drinks. Not the place to be if you are not into an overly touristy scene.

If its sun and surf that you're after for your holidays then this is the place to be. For me personally the only time that it is appealing is very early in the mornings and for some amazing sunsets, most times it is overcrowded. There are many options for accommodation around and its within walking distance to shops, bars, restaurants and so many other activities. Its ok but not quite the same as is used to be!

I first came here 4 years ago, it was clean and nice.
And even 2 years ago I was here and the beach was clean.

But this time it was disappointing!
So many rubbish washing up on the shore, in the sand you step on.

Also very crowed.

Not recommend if you are seeking for a clean and peaceful spot.

But to be fair, the sunset is still beautiful.

If it werent for all the rubbish, dog droppings, and hawkers this would be a really good beach. It seems that when tourist numbers are high coupled with rain a lot of rubbish is either left on the beach or washed ashore, there is a beach cleaning crew but they struggle at times. So visit when it is not wet season or tourist season. The dogs are out of control crapping everywhere and roaming in packs. Many people bring their own dog and do not clean up after them. On the plus side there are many food sellers, chair rentals, and the sunset is great!

Don't trust any photos of this place as they may look like "paradise" but up close is anything but.

You can't walk 5 steps without having someone try to sell you something. Like everyone else has said it is not worth visiting. You have to pay to use the toilet to change. You can't get any peace lying on the beach as someone will come up to you every 5 mins trying to get you to buy a sarong, or head rest, or jewellery,or a drink, or surfing lessons.

The beach is really dirty (filled with cigarette butts and plastic litter) and animals poop all along it and no one cleans it. If I had children I would be wary of letting them play in the sand.

I must admit that I was surprised to find the Kuta Beach area opposite the Hard Rock Hotel so full of pieces of wooden logs, sticks and twigs. I admit that once you get past this then you will experience warm waters, some fine sand areas. There was a very large crowd of people surrounding this popular area within Kuta. Everyone was very well behaved and it was surprisingly peaceful given the large number of tourists and locals present. As for myself I prefer other beaches within Bali.

We couldn't believe people were swimming between plastic bags & garbage.. Don't complain if you get sick. As far as we walk (one time only) it was garbage by the water line or piles & piles on the beach.

Sunset watching at Kuta Beach is sublime but the crowd can be a tad distracting. One is hard-pressed to find a peaceful spot to enjoy the setting sun. Nonetheless, part of Kuta's charm is the crowd. There are numerous establishments lining up the beachfront so there is never a problem for after-sunset activities.

This beach only for swimming and surfing, all water sport activity i.e jet ski, para sailing, banana boat had separate location. This arrangement make this beach special and more peaceful.

Waves and gently sloping beach make this beach very suitable for who want to learn to surf, especially for children. You can swim quite far from the beach to start the roll-out as water is not really high.

I absolutely love Kuta beach, it has a beautiful vision of the ocean and sky combined. Make sure you go down for a bintang at sunset to watch the sun fall and admire the array of deep colours that fill the sky.

Also another tip for new travellers to Bali, when you are approached by people trying to sell you their products that you have absolutely no interest in purchasing, just say "Tidak Tidak!" (pronounced 'tee-dak') which means "No no!" in Indonesian. I have travelled to Bali a few times now and found that to be the most effective way for them to leave you alone. They seem to respect that your taking the effort to speak in Indonesian and they get the impression that you are not a silly tourist!

I came to Kuta beach after visiting so many other beaches in short time. So, had enough of beaches at the time. The usual ladies offering massages, nail art, hairdo were present, not many cuz it was in the afternoon. Still a popular beach i see, just a bit unkept.

Before visiting Bali every review read about Kuta Beach was either very good or very bad and there is some truth to both. Kuta is a commercial center so you can expect malls and restaurants pretty much right up to the small strip of beach left. To a nature lover, that was pretty disappointing. However, I visited near sunset and I found a group of local boys playing soccer and spent about an hour watching the sun set. Kuta is still a lovely place to visit, though I wouldn't recommend sunbathing or planning to spend the day there. Instead go further north to the beaches near Legian or Seminnyak. If you want to visit more pristine beaches, I would recommend skipping Bali altogether and going to the next island over, Lombok, now those are some beautiful untouched beaches.

The one day we chose to have a relaxation day at the beach didn't end up being too relaxing as there were constantly people coming up to us trying to sell us things. Even as we were laying down women would come and nudge us to get our attention. Within about 15 minutes of being here the water turned black and huge pieces of driftwood washed up on the beach which I thought was very dangerous!

Kuta Beach is absolutely heartbreaking for anyone who loves the beach, surf and ocean.
We have been coming for over 15 years now and this is the worst I have seen it. So much plastic and rubbish washed up on the at least 5 meters wide and stretching the length of the beach was rubbish. Rubbish is visible in each breaking wave.
Some of the more obnoxious tourists even drop lit cigarette butts on the sand close to where barefoot children are playing.
If you visit Bali, make sure your hotel has a decent pool as you are a brave soul of you venture into the surf. Nothing like swimming through garbage on a hot day!
Bali needs tourism and unless they educate the Asian region about the environment, things will get worse.

We went in February just for the weekend, and while we had heard that that beach was dirty, nothing prepared us for how dirty it actually is. Trash everywhere, people sunbathing between piles of rubbish. It's really sad. The waves are great for learning to surf though, but on some days you do have to navigate between the plastic bags and floating debris, so not so nice. There are some initiatives which people/companies started to clean the beach, but it is nearly not enough. Go to Kuta to enjoy the activity, nightlife, small streets etc, but not the beach, it is way too dirty.

Kuta Beach was located directly across the street from our hotel. There are some beautiful entrance gates ornately decorated. The beach is quite long with numerous food and drink huts set up to grab your favorite refreshment. Water was warm, although the surf can be rough at times. Very enjoyble.

About 8 k.m of whitesand beach on the western side of Bali facing Indian Ocean, Kuta is famous and beautiful. Kuta once a fishing village is now a popular tourist resort location in Bali with lot of restaurants and clubs along the beach.

This is a nice beach with lots of sand and numerous local vendors looking to make a quick buck. You can buy beer, soda and chips. You can rent an umbrella/cabana. Numerous surfboard rentals.

It's an amazing place to watch sunset, but it gets maddeningly crowded at that time ☺️.

Been shopping in Kuta Poppies 2 and ended up at Kuta Beach. Hot and bothered so thought we would go enjoy an icy cold Bintang while watching the surfers.
Bintang super cold - excellent!! Shady umbrella and new/clean chairs at "beach bar/esky" - excellent.
Hawkers did their usual spiel - we said no thankyou a number of times. They then either stood right behind where we were sitting or standing right in front of us. We had to ask a number of times to move so we could see the ocean/surfers. We ended up asking bar/esky owner to ask them to leave us alone.
They moved to the side a bit but then just stared at us.
Would have been great atmosphere if they had left us alone after first few no thankyous.
Enjoyed watching the surfers.

This was my second worst experience at a beach. As a tourist Mecca I expected the beaches in Bali to be beautiful, picturesque paradises. The reality however was very different. Kuta beach was the first beach we visited during our stay (our first trip to Bali). So I am rating as average compared to the other hell-holes we visited.
Kuta beach does look lovely in the pictures but the beach itself is full of pedallers trying to forcefully sell you massages - they will actually start even though you tell them no. As well as hats, ice creams, offensive weapons, henna tattoos, bangles, and various other arts and craft pieces. We rented 2 plastic chairs from a guy called Ady @ 100,000 IDR for 4 hours, and purchased a variety of drinks from his cooler box, which were reasonable, when compared to other bars and restaurants. The sun was out and the beach was quiet which was nice, but the biggest disappointment of the whole experience is the rubbish. The beach is a dump, along the high waterline is a mixture of plastic bottles, bags, food wrappers, paper, dead animals etc. Considering how clean the rest of the tourist area's in Bali are kept, you think they'd take special care of the beaches. But alas they do not.

I have been to Kuta beach twice with my family. My first impression on Kuta was not good due to a little uncomfortable atmosphere but my second visit to Kuta beach was quite good due to general expenses there. The beach itself is not special but it was really easy to get very cheap but cozy housing around the beach and in the mornining, it was really good to take a walk through the main street and along the beach. We loved to see local boys surfing!

Kuta beach isn't the nicest beach in Bali by a long shot and yes you do tend to get hounded by locals trying to sell you everything under the sun but this is still a favourite of mine. I try to go there as often as possible for sunset bintangs on the beach at the little local bars, they are so friendly and accomodating. Nothing like sitting back in the hot sun with a cold beer watching some of the best sunsets I've ever seen in the world. I've been so many times I've lost count and I will continue to go for years to come

"YOU WANT COLD BEER?", "YOU WANT MASSAGE?". These an other such phrases will be hollered at you every few seconds. Gets very tedious very quickly. With this the beach is quite pleasant, decent sand, Somme waves though the water suffers due to the current rainy season. There are much beaches elsewhere in Bali, go and have a look around. Oh, it does appear to be compulsory to have a tattoo to enter Kuta beach, an odd anomaly.

Have to say that we live on an exceptional beach surrounded by nature preserves which has good waves for surfing where if there are 10 people per mile - it is a crowd. So Kuta with it's vendors and surf instructors and exorbitant prices for coconuts is not very attractive. There was not much trash, though, as blogs and photos from 2014 show. But Kuta Beach itself is a very unpleasant place: the only large grocery store is 3 miles away, sex workers literally grab you when you are walking the streets, a busy road is going along the beach, motor bikes and cars use petrol so there is a lot of exhaust. Another problem is that people seem to speak English but they do not really understand and do not admit that, so you get wrong food, for example.

Well its a wide sandy beach. The water is warm and sunsets sre amazing.
Dont expect sunbeds and umbrellas - you can get plastic chair under a tree if you order beer or some other bottle drink.
If you go in the the water its no way to swim. The only thing you can do is go as far as the water at your waist and just jump and ride on the waves.
Or you can hire an instructor who can teach you to ride a board. Riding the board is the main point to be there! you should at least try and see.

Came down to the beach to watch the sunset, which was beautiful.
The beach is very busy with both tourists and hagglers during nice days. (When the rain sets in, there is no one around). Not a good idea to come to Kuta beach if you want peace and quite, because it's the far from it. Someone either wants to sell you tattoos, henna tattoos, sarongs, pants, ice creams, Bintangs, anklets or jewellery ect. Still not a bad beach to go especially when it's so close to hotels, nightlife and restaurants.

Little disappointing with how dirty the sand it tho, just sitting on the sand my partner found 10 cigarette butts, not to mention all the other rubbish laying around, so definitely not the cleanest beach to sit on, but still OK to take a nice sunset photo

Right in the middle of the loud, raucous centre of Bali. A place to visit, once, then find the dozens of far nicer beaches.

Kuta Beach is an experience, pushy vendors, pushy surf schools, overcrowded and noisy, why would you come here? Just to see what all the fuss is about, that's it, unless you want to learn to surf. There are better places to learn, Balangan Beach for instance, but Kuta Beach is handy to where most tourists are.

Kuta Beach was conveniently located about two minutes walk from our resort. Every evening during our stay, after touring Bali we would come spend the rest of the day at this beach.

Less crowd, Less sun, and less market stalls trying to make a buck. The water itself isn't crystal clear as some may picture when thinking of Bali, there was bits of garbage washed up on shore.

But this beach is where you can observe locals coming out with their families, and see sculptures of idols. Definitely worth visiting.

Best part as soon as the sun set Kuta street was where the night life was, so it was perfect.

The most breathtaking experience of kuta beach was trying to surf. One must surely try surfing at kuta beach. An experience to stay for lifetime. It might take few attempts and patience to do it right, but the feeling of done it right at the end will make u feel happier than ever before.
The beach isn't as serene as you would expect. The water isnt clear blue (in fact the colour is a bit on the brown side). So to experience the clear and calm water beaches you need to visit other beaches in Bali.
Kuta is good for nightlife and shopping.
But for nature lovers who would seek serene landscape, kuta just might not be the right place to visit.
Yet one can stay in kuta and take scooters on hire and visit the peaceful and serene beaches.

Kuta beach reminded me of Waikiki beach. The beach is beautiful. The views spectacular. But there's a lot of people there too. The main drag of Kuta beach area is lined with many shops, restaurants, bars and nightclubs. Just like Waikiki. But the value of the US dollar is much better than Hawaii. So you don't have to worry about spending a lot of cash while you enjoy yourself. The only thing that's puzzles me, is that at the public restrooms on the beach. They require you to pay a fee. It's not a lot, like 25 cents. But you pay after you're done. Not before you go in. Struck me as strange. Most places you pay before you've done your business.

Long and wide with shallow waters for swimming, this beach offers room to play even though well touristed. Rent surf and boogie boards, barter a cold beer from one of the many entrepreneurs, and enjoy the great sand. Few coral or shells to cut your feet allowed for my barefoot run down its length. Watch out though for some occasional trash and pop tops or your day will end up like Jimmy Buffets Margaritaville.

Everyone raves about Kuta beach it could be a fantastic beach but.....
There is rubbish all over the beach..
In just a short walk I passed used nappies condoms and timber with nails sticking out.
This put me off spending longer at what could be a great beach. The local authority could employ people to clean up this beach and I am sure more people would come.

Was staying right at beach front in kuta and I could see lots of surfers at the beach learning and doing various surfing activities. The beach access is from any of the part of the beach road and you will also find people selling beers to just sit and relax by the beach

I don't understand why people rave about Pantai Kuta - the beach is, in my opinion, very course with almost black-brown sand and heavily polluted. Then there is the matter of street vendors trying to ply their trade be it legal or not!

Although a very large beach, there is no protection from the swell and erosion has made a mess of the place with walking along the beach almost requiring hiking boots because of the angle of inclination close to the water's edge - depending on the tide.

I love Bali and I enjoy staying around the Kuta area, but for the above reasons, Pantai Kuta is certainly not my most favourite beach.

Kuta Beach is really a long stretch of sand. We walked about three quarters of a mile on it today and were not even close the end. People were surfing, frolicking in the wave, sunbathing, and just walking like us. The beach could be so spectacular except for the trash on beach. It appears the locals don't really care. The tourists complain but do nothing, that's me. There were boards in the surf with nails in them. Would seem like a little effort from all of the people selling stuff on the beach would be able to clean it up. My rant is done. The beach is beautiful. The surf looks amazing. But it could be like I said earlier, fantastic. The only reason I rate it very good is because of it's length. If you go for more than a few minutes be sure to use sunscreen.

In all of the years that I have been travelling to Bali I have never experienced a sunset on Kuta Beach. Yesterday was my first time and it was nothing short of amazing. Not even the scattered rubbish that lined the foreshore could detract from this most wonderful sight. Everyone who comes to Bali should experience this at least once.

We spent a lot of time at Kuta Beach Bali during our two week stay . We sit at our favourite at called Made Jimmy's Bar . He has the coldest Bintang on the beach and great service . My young teenage kids had surfing lessons for
100 000 for about hour , or as long as they wanted really . If kids the surfing basics they can't hire a board for 50 000 . The locals hassle you constantly to buy wares or have a massage , but that's all part of it. If you want a quiet spot this isn't the place.

Love this beach!! Very clean, the vendors are very friendly and do not bother you. A lounge bed can cost you around 50000 Rupiah for an hour but it very clean and well maintained. Also do have the coconut water.. Its super heavy but very very tasty. That can cost you about 50000 Rupiah fpr one. Do bargain. Local ladies also offer massages, pedicure and sell trinkets. Indulge in a cheap foot massage, get fancy nails, have coconut water, click a lot of pictures. You can do everything or nothing at all! But do visit!

Kuta Beach is famous as the surfers paradise, how ever the waves aren't that big. You can get a sunbed for 50 rupiah and that's about it. Alot if beach sellers disturb you while you are there. Not the best beach, but neither not the worst one I've been to.

I enjoy having some cocktails and then having fun with the vendors making deals and having that experience. When we travel we love to pick an afternoon, sit on the beach, have drinks and shop.

If your looking for a beautiful, peaceful ocean front then this is not for you.

If you would love to enjoy some drinks and experience vendor shopping then I highly recommend Kuta Beach.

Some money changers in Legian and Kuta that are on the street sides appear to be offering a very good rate.. very high than most money changers specially the proper authorised ones. These money changers like to use small moneys (Rp20,000) which you could end up with big piles of 20,000 notes. That was how they tricked me. The guy counted a few times but also tried to distract me from counting the money again. He asked such things like 'where you from', 'where you stay Sir?'.. 'where you want to go?' ..'you want to buy good cheap tshirts sir?' This guy tried so many ways to get me out of focus when counting 20,000 notes and 10,000 notes.

Bali needs tourists so they should try to do good things but instead they try their best to rip visitors off.

My suggestion is to use the money changer in the airport or the bank.

Rather crowded, so don't expect a quiet stretch of beach. Beach has nice sand and children enjoyed playing on it. People around surfing and/or sunning. Local people want your custom so expect they asking to do your nails, massages, sell items, etc. One after another they keep coming. It would be good if they were situated in one area near the entrance or they passed by so you could see their wares, but not continually asking you to buy one after the other. However, if you just let them know kindly you are not interested, that can help both your attitude and theirs. Lots of shops around the area. Would be good if people would clean up after themselves and not leave plastics of various kinds and trash around! Almost seems to need some "clean up police".

Kuta Beach is pretty - a pretty ordinary beach, though. I am not a fan of Kuta period - its overly crowded and way too touristy. If you head to Kuta Beach, be prepared to be bombarded by people trying to sell you everything from bracelets to sarongs to glow-lights. There are far better beaches in Bali.

Beach is nice, free from coral, but lots of hawkers trying to sell you massages and various trinkets. They can be very persistent if you give them the slightest bit of interest. Be careful and don't say maybe unless you're intending to buy something. Water is very warm. Moderate surf. Grey sand. Can get dirty at times but generally pretty well maintained.

Its a nice beach to chill and have a drink, the sunset is beautiful. There will be a lot of people trying to sell you stuff or services.

Couldn't even enjoy the beach because we were bombarded by sales every few steps. (Sometimes 3 at a time). People don't like to take no for an answer and try to use polite conversations to jail you to them. I'd advise ignoring people and walking past them. There are 100's of "Surf Instructors" there.

No wonder the KUTA BEACH always has many visitors.
But no matter how crowd it is, there is always some place for you to play either with the sand or with the ocean,
And when the sun set came, it was such a beautiful sunsets that I saw. And some people taping it with their gadgets. Love to go there, over and over again.

We loved Kuta beach! The water was warm and beautiful! The only downside is that it is a bit of a tourist trap, but most people know that before they get there. Just be careful with the locals trying to sell you things-- I got suckered into a massage and manicure, and ended up paying way more than I would have if I'd gone somewhere else. But the beach was lovely, and we will definitely be back.

The beach looks stunning from afar but up closer has quite a bit of rubbish. Very safe for swimming and surfing and there are lifeguards apparently. Waves were better at high tide for surfing.

Constant hecklers as you try to relax are annoying and persistent. Worse than kuta streets I think.

Cold bintang from any of the umbrella people is great and cheap (25k each). Can hire foam surfboards from them too 50k/hour and are ideal to learn on or 150k with a lesson.

Sunrise is very pleasant as no hecklers are out and nice cool temperature. Water still very warm tho.
Sunset it amazing to watch from kuta as it faces west. Great photos and heaps of people make a good vibe.

It was a really disappointing visit to Kuta beach. A such great place with one of the most beautiful sunsets that I saw in my life, but the most dirty beach ever. From plastic cups, plastic bags to dirty nappies on the sand.
Such a shame.
All the tourists should look after themselves and clean up their mess before leaving. It's not fare on the nature.

The Kuta beaches can be enjoyed by all with swimming, surfing, boogie boarding, suntanning, just relaxing on the beach and taking strolls. The warm sea water is perfect for those wishing to learn to surf. Lots of surf instructors available on the beach offering 1hr surf lessons for about 150rupiah. Beach umbrellas, mats and loungers are readily available for hiring on the beach so no need to buy and cart around. Flea marketers also sell their beach wares such as sarongs, sun hats, beach towels etc which can be bargained to really low prices. Cold drinks and snacks are also available. Due to the heat and humidity it's best to swim early morning or late afternoons. Sunsets are breathtaking. We enjoyed our 10 day stay in Bali and will treasure all the good times. Bali I miss you already.

if you looking for a clean white sand beach, deff not kuta. go try nusa dua
if you surf lover, then this is the best spot with huge wave and lively place to go
beach are unclean and nothing special at this beach except the wave and calmy place to sit back and relax while listening to the ocean.

somehow along the beach. there's local people whom burn papers and religious statue near the beach and no beach bench to rent, disappointed :(
will suggest for Seminyak for more wide beach for the sunset.

We went to the beach for a swim every day - it was over the road from our hotel.
Some days there was some surf, other days it was calm.
We are a family with adult kids - we are not surfs.
The beach for us was to cool down and get the salt water onto our skin.
We did notice the salt was very strong - not sure why it varies from beach to beach. It was good for our skin though especially the inevitable Bali mosquito bites.
We did not use any of the beach vendors but we did leave all valuables at the hotel and left nothing but our shoes on the beach while we swam.

It was a great day to start the day.

kuta beach if full of rubbish they clean it every morning but there is just so much rubbish too scared to swim in the water. If you don't want to swim then around sunset head down and pull up a chair and the local will bring you $2 beers and watch the sunset perfect. Just be prepared for the onslaught of people trying to sell you stuff and wanting to give you a massage be polite say no and it all calms down in about 5 mins. You actually get to meet some great local people and we went to the same guy most afternoons and once they get to know you they leave you alone. Go for the atmosphere not the swimming

One of the must do things when you came to Bali was a long walk along the beach and watching the sunset over Kuta Beach. The beaches were pristine- kept litter free by the people who rented their little space on the beach, the locals were friendly and accepted that you weren't interested in purchasing their goods without pestering you continuously and you could rent a chair and umbrella cheaply. Boy have things changed and not in the positive sense. The beaches were littered with debris and rubbish and the locals were not the friendly happy people that I remembered- these people are trying to make a living and will persist until you buy or move. The opportunity to rent a chair and umbrella is still there, as is the sunset, however, I watched it in Tuban sitting on a beautiful clean, lawned beach area, cold drink in hand - better than Kuta?- definitely ! This is another example of tourism having a negative effect on a beautiful country.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,363,20>===============  
We walked along the beach for about 3km so if you want to go for a good long walk without car fumes and honking horns then this is good BUT, the beach is filthy, the shore line was littered with rubbish the whole way. Nappies, plastic cups, straws are the things that stood out for me. So many plastic cups! When we got closer to the Kuta square, we were pestered by hawkers along the way.
The real highlight for the beach is to sit and watch the sun set. Hint: you are less likely to be pestered when you are closer to the water.
There is no where that we could see to wash our feet except for paying for the privilege which is a little annoying because the black sand really needs to come off...

This is a fun beach to go to, I went with 2 friends whilst travelling in August 2015. I would say this is more of a lively beach, quite busy with lots of sports going on and it does have more of a young traveler vibe. I don't surf but apparently it's really good for that (lots of Aussies told us!) and there's lots of restaurants, bars and shops nearby. There's a bit of rubbish here and there but that's to be expected as lots of people use the beach! It is next to a busy road so there is a bit of noise from that and we did find lots of people were trying to sell us things throughout the day which was a bit annoying. However, we had a good time and it was worth the visit.

Everyone tells you to go to Kuta when you're in Bali but I'd say that this beach is a little bit overrated. It's very crowded and dirty, as you can see literally plastic bags and cans while you walk along the coast. It's only partially white-sand beach now and the sellers will always try to persuade you to buy things (massage service/soda/souvenirs/tattoo), so it's hard to enjoy the beach and look for peace. However I think the surfers will enjoy this beach.

It a nice n pleasant walk along the beach.
Many activities you can do there.
The beach quite clean, amazingly - bcz I expected it to be not so clean as there's a lot of people there.
If u not kinda all those water activities, there's mall you can go n shop or take a rest at and eat at restaurant nearby.
If you r looking for local stuff, there's row of shop that sells local stuff nearby. U also can bargain there.

A lovely beach, not crowded comparing with the street along it! The wave is perfect for surfing, not swimming. There are plenty surfing boards/lessons offered on the beach. The price was good, and the people were very nice. Both my children had surfing lessons and enjoyed.
The trees on the beach provided some shade during the day. And the small bars nearby provided shelters during rain season downpours! The people there were really nice. They allow all of us to stay when it's pouring and you don't have to be there custom.

The rocks out of the shopping mall is a good place to watch the sunset

You never been to Bali if you haven't been to Kuta beach, thats what they said. This beach is more on the touristy side, so don't imagine peace clean beach. In fact you will see lots of trash everywhere alongside the coast area. Also the local seller will swarm over you trying to sell everything from a temporary tattoo, surfing lesson, beverage, up to massage service. If you imagine holiday in Bali is sunbathing with beer in hand while being massage then come here, but if you are looking for a peace quality time then try other less commercial beaches.

While it's a beautiful and busy beach, we found the waters to be very very dirty. Garbage was floating everywhere, you had to be careful where you swam. It looks like they had some kind of sewage running into the area where we were, so we got out of there ASAP. This was a while ago though, so it may have changed since then.

I know people say there is more to bali than Kuta, but I just love the place, for me its all about the hustle and bustle, the beach is no different, atmosphere is busy but good, get your hair braided by one of the beach ladies, buy a Bintang from one of the local boys, have a swim, have fun, explore :)

Title: WHAT ONCE WAS.......................
ID#: 338316990

Yes folks.......what once was a friendly, relatively clean, pristine beach is now an an overcrowded, polluted bit of sand with hawkers spoiling any peaceful moments with offers to purchase anything from a sarong / massage to illicit substances + other illegal activities - " good for you mister ". The streets are full of Bintang muscle shirt clad bogans, beer in hand out for good time at anyone's expense. Mind you, Beachwalk Mall is not too scruffy a place to watch a movie or grab a Food-Court -like bite to eat... but the increase of would-be scammers continues to tarnish. My advice- stay away from the 'dark-side' of Bali.... Kuta Beach is not for everyone.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,365,50>===============  
A long shore line extends in Kuta and this beach is great attraction. Access is from many points and most tourists visiting the Malls also can walk up to the beach, spend time or sip a beer from the sea facing joints. It is a beautiful beach and gets crowded during the evening hours.

The beach was so clean and the sunsets were amazing. Their are lots of locals who sell everything you need. Great for surfing
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,365,30>===============  
I've had some surfing lessons here. The waves are good for beginner. At least this is what I can say as a beginner. The beach is nice in the evening and you can just sit and watch sunset. It can get a bit of a litter sometimes but that is problem in Bali in general. It's not very clean island and rubbish is pretty much everywhere. Would I recommend visiting Bali? No. But if you've already come to Bali then enjoy most of it and visit Kuta.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,365,30>===============  
Lovely beach although unfortunately covered in trash so seemed a bit of a hazard. We received free beach photos from the "Bakung Sari" and the sunrise was magical.

After many years of everyone else telling me about Bali, it was finally time to visit. Reluctant and unsure about the security issues but glad we went and surprised by many of the things we saw.
Beach is not a patch on what we have here on the Sunshine Coast and the surf looked dangerous.. Some great beachfront cafes, a must visit. I was concerned at the number of tourists going for a surf with just one instructor, wouldn't meet WPH&S standards in western countries.
Felt very unsafe in some of the beach side street shopping areas and dealing with some of the arrogant taxi drivers but there are plenty of very good one's once things settle in and you get to know the good the bad and the ugly side of Bali.
Can highly recommend a roof top beer at the Sheraton Hotel which overlooks the beach.

Returning after 5 years it's still dirty and full of hawkers hassling you. Not the place for a stroll or swim - it's a shame especially at sun down which I recommend doing from a restaurant or hotel at Kuta

We are among so many lucky people who were on new years in Kuta Beach... never saw so so many fire works lights music ever in my life.. new year celebration at its best in kuta

This beach is amazing. One of Bali's best for sure. Laid back and sporting tons of surfer dude instructors (negotiate for 100-150 RMB for a lesson), henna tattoo artists, drink-sellers, and masseuses, it has everything. The water is warm, and the beach is pretty clean for now bustling it is. There's a great walkway along the back, but walk on the sand, it's perfect. Restaurants and shacks selling snacks and drinks line the walkway. The road opposite the beach has tons of bars too, if the beach is too sandy.

Swim in the ocean around sunset and experience Bali bliss as the sun sets pink and beautiful over the ocean you're in.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,366,30>===============  
Nice beach with lots of surfing activity. Long beach just to stroll, run or sit back and relax. Would not say a perfect white sand beach but still a great beach to spend time upon.

I have swum on Kuta beach many times over the years and enjoyed the warm water and unique Kuta atmosphere, beach sellers and massagers are fine by me.

I always swim between the flags but yesterday noticed that so do many learner board riders, some even with their instructors!!

Obviously this is not safe for swimmers but when I mentioned it to a Balinese instructor [who had 2 students at the time in the swimmer's flagged area] he was quite rude to me and said it was 'his area'. He did then [very slowly] move them to the board area and at the same time a female instructor moved some students as well but with the number of learners there at present and many swimmers not realising the danger of an out of control board and rider I wonder how many accidents happen.

Do the learners who just hire a board get told of the rules involving the flags? I was actually hit by a board [no damage done as I saw it coming] within 10 minutes of getting into the water and the rider seemed surprised when I told him about the regulations.
I will go to a different area of the beach today and hope for a better outcome but please, Surf School instructors, be fair to swimmers!!!

On our first day in Bali we were being swamped on the streets by people so I suggested to my husband to go down to the beach to relax and put our feet in the water. We were immediately swamped by at least 7 women wanting to sell us singlets, towels, manicures, pedicures, massage, braids, you name it. All we wanted to do was relax. It was an awful experience. They got quite aggressive and offensive if you said no. Would never come back here

My favourite time of day is my morning walk along this beach after sunrise. Not too busy but definitiely not deserted either. Good spot for relaxing and watching the tourists learning how to surf.....maybe i'll try on my next visit.

Great beach to spend the day relaxing at, getting cheap massages, manicures or pedicures, Kuta Beach has it all.
It could be a little cleaner but all in all my experiences at the beach have all been positive. Remember to pack the sunscreen though, the sun over a long period of time is deadly.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,366,20>===============  
My personal view is that Kuta beach is rather for surfers, not best option to choose for families who search for the classical beach atmosphere. Sandy beach quite dirty each and whole day (not cleaned well enough). Sellers are pushy and even if you express your wish not to buy - then they sit around you and push for some sales.
But on the positive side, water temperature is pleasant, around 28 C. Sunset is beautiful!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,367,30>===============  
The beach was very grubby when we were there in December. Apparently this is in part caused by the storms at this time of year, but given the fact that there is never any shortage of manpower in Bali why don't the authorities employ people to clean up the beach every evening as happens elsewhere? It is also very popular and crowded, but if you like surfing then this is the place to be. Personally I'm not a surfer nor a sunbather so I only spend a short time there, just enough to buy an armful of t-shirts from the ever present peddlers. There is an army of such people on the beach trying to sell drinks, souvenirs, clothes, etc. Be prepared to haggle if you do buy. The sunsets viewed from the beach are really worth looking at and the water is warm if you do go in.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,367,40>===============  
More than three times visit this beach and still it has a beautiful sunset. Free of charge you can enjoy whole afternoon at the beach. Our lovely boy enjoyed playing with sands, sea, and waves so much. Still love this beach.

Not very clean beach, but with wonderful sunsets you had ever seen. You can do yoga or surf if you prefer.

To crowded now because there is new big shopping mall opposite of the beach and difficult to park motor bike.

The good thing from Kuta is the beautiful sunset, party in the night ....in sky garden. nice wave to practice surfing and so many professional surf class like odysey and up2U and also closed to the hotel. only need walking to reach the beach

I was there during rainy season (February 2010). It was a nice place to learn surfing. Safe guards were nice with us when strong rain started. However, between rains sea was dirty, coconuts and branches were in water-it is quite dangerous. At the evening it was windy there

When I went surfing, I surfed with many garbage... many plastics and tins. I was nervous whether tins would cut my finfers...

Last week whilst my wife and son went to Waterbon Park, my daughter and I went to the Kuta markets and beach.
I was so disappointed to see the beach was so dirty with debris on the sand and dirty sand throughout.
Kuta has a reputation of being one of the must see places, the beach you can miss, enjoy the market for bargains, have a beer along one of the cafes and just relax.
We were staying at Nusa Dua, which is alittle isolated from Kuta,but the beach was great.
Bali is where we go to enjoy the water and beach, so be prepared for surprises and shocks along Bali's coastline.

Had a little walk there during the night with my boyfriend to see what it's like in their to have something to compare from Legian and Seminyak Beach, well it was just the same though. I'd only get fascinated with the waves.
But they sure does offer surfing boards for rent. What I have noticed with the prices is that from how high the waves are the lower the prices are.

What we encountered so annoying while walking in there was locals offering us weeds and mushrooms. Eh?
For real? LOL
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,367,50>===============  
Kuta during the night may not be your thing, but going there to people watch on the vast, wide beach, sipping a cold Bintang and watching the world go by, well its pretty nice! Rent a lounge chair, or just sit on one of the plastic chairs with the drink vendors.

Only downside is the trinket and massage touts. They are pretty persistent so you have to be fairly mean to get them to go away.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,367,30>===============  
Kuta beach is really busy which si not a bad thing Close to shops and restaurants which is good. Keep your belongs close by!!!! You can hire a beach cabanna, just haggle when it comes to price. SWe paid about 50,000RP

We stayed in Kuta in 2 different seasons, early Desember and after Christmas. The difference between those two seasons were massive. In early December there were less people on the beach and almost no trash, the beach was beautiful. After Christmas it was packed with people and there was trash everywere on the beach. You could not go into the sea without getting trash attached to you. I wished that people would have more respect for the enviroment.

Visit once to say to the folks at home you've been but don't be surprised at the volume of rubbish strewn up the sand after the tide recedes. There's cheap options of food and drink galore from sand-side vendors and a few thousand rupiah will snag you a cabana and beach umbrella for the day.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,368,30>===============  
Kuta beach is great for surfing, and long walks in the very early morning. Kuta area is however very busy, with an ethnic mixed crowd and lot's of young people who are there to party, but there's nothing wrong with that if it's for you...:)

During the day, the temperature gets really hot and it becomes almost unbearable to stay on the beach; however, a ton of people from all sorts of background gathers on it to admire the sunset at the end of the day which makes it quite a wonderful experience to live. One major downside, other than the heat during the day, is all the litter that accumulates on the beach and that is not picked-up very often.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,368,30>===============

if you are traveling to bali avoid kuta. beside the cute Australian surfers there is not much. the beach is dirty and full of people trying to sell you things. although the sunset is 10/10 it's not worth the trip to kuta. If you are staying here be sure to haggle with prices because they know you are a tourist and will ask for an absurd price for things. you should be able to get a taxi from the airport to your hotel for between 100-150k. the umbrellas you should be able to get 2 chairs for 70k for 3 hours

I stayed for 10 minutes on that filthy beach. The water is full of floating garbage. The Hawkers are chasing you either with lessons for surfing or offering a sun bed or an umbrella with very expensive price (12$ and that is to expensive for prices there) plus other cheap products the hawkers number were larger that the tourists. The beach sand is black and not clean at all. If you want to enjoy water go to other beaches in Nusa Dua or Seminyak but Kuta Just go for hanging out there or just for the company but for swimming don't go.

First time I had Kuta Beach in 2009 during Ramadan vacations in Indonesia. Hence that was peak time and a bit difficult to get hotel reservation. Kuta beach is very clean and long. Very good and well known for surfing and other relevant sports.

This is not so much about the beach itself but the wonderful time had by a group of friends sitting on chairs in the sand having a few Bintangs chatting and laughing and watching the sunset. There's a bathroom close by you pay for but it's clean. There's restaurants to get food and bars if you don't want sand in your toes. The best afternoon I had in Bali, just chilling on Kuta beach.

Not a very great beach but very nice and crowded. this is a great spot if your wish to learn surfing as you have a lot of people surfing all day long but ensure you bargain the price to almost a fourth as pricing for newbies is a ripper

Sitting under an umbrella for 2 hours on the beach is not my idea of fun. I was there during Christmas and had to change money. Ran into the nearest one to my hotel. There was a sandwich board out on the street and the money changers are in a room inside a laneway. Luckily I was with a friend. I needed to change U$400, so one of the men counted out over 6 million IRP in 50,000 R notes. Of course I recounted the huge pile of bills and after each stack of 20, I folded one bill over the stack. The man did not like and proceeded to take them off and started moving the money over to the other end of the counter. I was suspicious right away. Again he counted out the money and again I recounted folding over one of the bills. He then grabbed his money (do not ever let go of your money that you want to change until you have your hands on the exact amount of local money) and told us to "get out" and find another money changer. That was strange and I knew something was up.
We then walked into a 2nd exchange (again with the sandwich board outside) and the fellow told my friend the exchange rate and that there was a 15% tax (not commission) that he had to charge as it was a government tax. That was a lie and we went into yet a 3rd exchange. This one was unbelievable. The man took out a calculator and was fixed in some way that would never give the right amount. My friend had his own calculator which came up with another amount. There was a huge stack of money counted out in front of us and to our amazement, he took a small stack of the money and slipped it into a drawer behind the counter. It was so obvious. Anyway, be warned. Do not go anywhere to exchange where there is a sandwich board outside and be suspicious if you are given only 50,000 bills. Actually this was a highlight for me in Kuta. I have travelled extensively and had never come across anything like this.

I have love-hate relationship with this beach. Free entry, beautiful sunset... but rubbish and hawkers everywhere. Better watch Kuta's sunset from Discovery Mall or Beachwalk.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,370,20>===============  
Unfortunately people (and I would say locals and tourists) think the shoreline is there to deposit all amounts of rubbish. You cannot walk along the water without having to dodge plastic bottles, wrappers, old shoes, cans, etc, etc. Beaches no where near as appealing as Australian beaches and having to put up with all the rubbish just lets it down even more.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,370,50>===============  
Amazing sunset and do take a stroll along the beach and be immersed by the sounds of crashing waves plus soothing wind blowing through your face.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,370,30>===============  
If your idea of a beach setting is plastic chairs, rubbish everywhere, and hawkers trying to sell you Sarongs and Towels then Kuta Beach is for you! If you would rather a quiet, post card worthy scene then try further north. A few minutes walking along the sand being swamped by hecklers insisting I buy $1 Sarongs and Bracelets was enough. Kuta Beach is not for me.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,370,20>===============  
DO NOT use money changers in Poppies Lanes 1 & 2 - those offering over the odds exchange rates - are their only to rip you off. eg exchanging A$200 got ripped for $60, later at a different location tried to exchange A$100 they tried to rip off A$65 and when caught out would not do the money exchange. BEWARE. Use a reputable money exchanger offering proper rates - those that seem to good to be true are.
PS they are very good and even when you know they will rip you off you cannot see them do it.

From the beaches I've seen in Bali so far I'd say this would be one of the top beaches for beginner surf lessons, based on the waves. It is however a very busy beach, main tourist destination etc so sometimes can be very overcrowded.

Kuta Beach sunset was spectacular!
Cleaner beach than I expected, sand like Southern California in color and texture. Many vendors and everything is readily available within steps. Women had to pay to use the restroom, I think it was like $4USD, though, I may have had too much sun. Amazing people watching and great spirit here, waves are beginner but fun for a soft board and the little ones ! Don't miss the sunset while walking the beach into town for a night of fun!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,370,40>===============  
The waves were great for body surfing, boogie boarding, or surfing. Very consistent sets all day long and at times very big. Plenty of room on the beach and in the water for everyone. No crowding during our visits. The sand and the surf were the only things that were free. The toilets required a fee and were substandard. The services and items for purchase sold by the beach vendors were numerous and included massages, beach chairs, beds, umbrellas, food, drink, surf boards and boogie boards. At times their offers became a little too aggressive but if you sit/lay closer to the water their offers decline.

Kuta has got some major waves. Get past the breaks and you can ride all day long! Depending on the season the waves can get to a decent size. So over all...have your larger board ready.

Kuta Beach is one of the 'classic' beach in Bali, besides Sanur in the Eastern Bali. People flock to this beach for sunset watching, and this beach can be very crowded around 6-7 PM. Access to this area is rarely smooth, expect traffic jam at almost anytime during the 8 AM - 10 PM timeframe.

Parking was an issue if you drive by yourself to Kuta, but fortunately now you can park your car in Beachwalk Mall which has plenty of basement parking slots, with a very moderate parking fee.

My family opt to go to other Western-facing beach for sunset viewing ( Dreamland or Padang-Padang ), although those beaches are quite far from Kuta / Legian / Seminyak ( around 1 hour drive in normal traffic ), but the beaches there are far cleaner. But people go to Kuta just for the beach; we go to Kuta for its shopping ( Kita Square, Beachwalk ), dining ( many restaurants & pubs along the Kuta Road ), and photo opt in some must-take-a-photo spots, such as in front of the Hard Rock Hotel's giant surfboard.

Center of all tourist attraction. You can find anything in here. Massage, tattoo, hairdo, surfing, waterboom, just name it. Surrounding with great hotel and souvenir markets.

We headed over to the beach to eat some ice creams we'd bought from the convenience store late on our last afternoon in Bali - thought we'd check out the local surfing on this famous beach. No sooner were we on the beach than we were surrounded by hawkers - some of them especially obtrusive, trying to massage our shoulders to sell their service. The sunset was probably spectacular but we didn't stick around long enough to see it!

This is by far the most disturbing and ugly and filthy beach I have ever been to. The locals on this beach are like hooligans let loose on attack All they want to do is take as much money out of u and if u don't give in they get aggressive. Nusa dua girgi beach is super amazing Go there. Don't stay in Kuta unless you are into whores and drugs. Seminayak is the area to live.

My husband and son enjoyed their surf lesson (the surf really is great), and we could see the natural beauty of this beach. BUT, it is now covered in trash and hawkers harass you non-stop to buy everything from snacks and drinks to random stuff. They return over and over, even if you say very clearly that you don't want anything. We enjoyed our sunset on the beach, but decided not to return to swim. It could be beautiful if they cleaned it up and managed the hawker situation.

I traveled to Kuta with my husband and kids (9 and 12) this past December. We went to the beach hoping to swim, but there was so much trash, on the sand and in the water, that we just couldn't do it. The views were nice and it was fun to see what people were selling, and there were definitely surfers everywhere. We just couldn't get past the crazy amounts of garbage everywhere (more than any other place we visited in Bali).

Great place to learn to surf and have fun on boogie boards we always go here and love it...
Close to where everything is happening..

Just make sure you take only what you need and around 50/60000 rph to hire a boogie board for an hour or more...
I don't recommend purchasing anything on the beach as its 1 +100 others surrounding you.... Something you learn ones or twice...
If you purchase a massage, pay after not before as they walk away after 2 seconds my experience anyway..and it's not a relaxing Idea unless you hire someone to keep others away but it's all part of the fun of learning...

A beautiful place to watch the sunset and sunrise.

A bustling and good looking beach is let down by high amounts of rubbish strewn everywhere. We're told that this is due to recent high rains so maybe not always like that but it does put you off sunbathing.

The waves can be fairly large too so OK for a short dip for experienced swimmers but not for small children.

I love Kuta and the sunsets are a must for any holiday. BUT the rubbish on the beach is getting worse. It's almost enough to put you off coming to Bali - really quite sickening. Hopefully they clean it up at the start of every day but I saw no signs of anyone really caring about it. Very sad.

Unfortunately Kuta Beach has been invaded by too many hawkers trying to sell you everything. The beach is awash with plastic bags, cans, bottles and debris- an absolute disgrace . The two metre high beach wall which was constructed about 10 years ago obstructs your view from the road so you lose your sense of ambiance of being near the beach.

Not sure what they can do about it, but the rubbish in the water and on shore at times, was incredible. They reckon don't swim after it rains. Looks nice from afar. Safe for swimming in one spot, where it was patrolled. Otherwise, up to you. You'll get hassled for surfboards etc.

Perhaps it was the time of the year, but Kuta and Bali generally was crowded, stinky and polluted. Rubbish is everywhere and it stinks. The vendors only seemed concerned with getting as much money from you as they can while offering as little as possible. I can't understand the attraction of this place. Not welcoming, friendly or relaxed at all.

If you go to Bali you should visit Kuta beach! Even though it is probably not a life changing visit I think it is well worth a visit just to see what the fuss is about.

Kuta beach is a place which I feel a kind of hate - love to.

I love the accessibility to beginner surf and this is the place where I first tried to and learned to surf. I love the atmosphere here in the sunset and we shall not forget that it is a beatiful place. The sand bottom is good for swimming when the waves don't grow high.

What I don't like is the amount of people walking around on the beach selling stuff never giving you a calm moment. The people are usually very friendly but they are way too many and come way too often.

In the winter (around December) all the plastic waste of Java gets washed out to the ocean by the monsoon. This trash gets carried away by currents and ends up on Kuta beach - rendering the water so littered almost none want to swim or surf here. The amount of waste coming here is not possible to grasp. Google Kuta beach trash if you need more confirmation of this.

A must to visit to watch a magical sunset! Good to visit at any time and for all age and ethnic groups - so many ready to provide you with icy drinks eats watches sunglasses novelties carvings jewelry clothing pearls jewelry real and imitation silver DVD's kites shells ice cream and on an on it goes - they have hundreds of venues and all aim to please rent surf boards boogy boards and will take you out fishing or just sight seeing if you wish. Has a Turtle protection base and a Life Saving base. A section where cremations frequently occur and long boats beached good camera bait - well worth multi visits!

Im sorry to tell you this folks, but the rubbish has now really started to get bad on Kuta/Padma/Double6 and many more of the beaches in Bali.

The problem is caused by ignorant local people dumping their rubbish into the waterways/rivers and drains.

Once the December rains start, the rubbish is washed out to the ocean and of course gets washed up on the beaches.

I speak to many locals about this and many of them just accept it, or are ignorant. Its so sad. Sad to see these ignorant people trashing such beautiful part of the planet. When will they wake up?

If you choose to come to Bali, be prepared for filthy beaches throughout late December, and all through the wet season until March, when the rains stop.

the beach is vast and pretty good for surfers due to high waves coming near to the beach. not advisable for non swimmers and young children. pretty clean beach and also lots of small shops to buy bali souvenirs.

Very beautiful beach. A lot of beach bars with sun beds that surf drinks and sometimes also have wifi. You can just hang out there and watch the surfers do their thing or try it out yourself.
Many guys try to sell stuff like sun glasses, massages, surf lessons, you name it...it can be annoying sometimes but that's just how it is in touristic areas.
Definitely worth to visit when visiting Bali and also very beautiful when the sun goes down.

A great experience and a lot of fun sightseeing. For as far as the eye can see, the beach from Kuta to Legian to Seminyak is lined with colourful stalls with umbrellas and chairs and locals selling ice cold Bintangs.
Hawkers selling fake watches, jewellery, sarongs etc.
Black sand with clear, warm water, good waves for beginners and plenty of surfboard hire stalls including instructors if needed. Life guard on duty as rips can be extreme.
We had plenty of space to move about in November, but I would imagine it would be a very busy and popular place in peak holiday times.

Although this beach can be messy you cannot argue with the sunset and incredible swell.

For those on a budget you can eat local Indonesian food at local prices from the street vendors that hang under the trees near the wall. They normally feed the local bar workers.

There's a turtle conservation centre located at Kuta beach where they breed baby turtles up to a certain age before they release them into the sea. They allow the public to help in the release of the turtles and it's free. You can make a donation if you like to support their meaningful cause. I was there incidentally at the right timing when they were about to release baby turtles. Check their signboard located at the beach for the actual timings.

This activity is especially popular among tourists and there were many Aussie tourists with young children who were very excited to release the baby turtles - myself included. It was a very novel experience.

We were told by the guide that for all the baby turtles we released that day (there were close to a hundred), only 1 or 2 would survive till adulthood. Many of us were shocked to hear this fact. He explained that this is because it's very difficult for the baby turtles to survive on their own with predators everywhere (even a small sea crab eats baby turtles) and buried turtle eggs fall prey to snakes and birds. This is why their turtle conservation is so important as turtles may soon face extinction if this continues.

I named the baby turtle that I released, Molly and my partner's Oscar.

Suitable for all ages. Visited in 2014. Great experience.

I'm really really disappointed with the beach, the amount of plastic and waste in the water was not only upsetting but something in this day and age isn't acceptable.

Because no one cares it means that there is a vicious cycle between the locals and the tourists, locals don't care unless they're getting paid and the tourists see the rubbish and then think it's acceptable to discard bottles, cans and cigarette butts.

It's a shame as it has the potential to be a lovely beach but after a day of swimming through plastic and another 1/2 day picking out Kg's of rubbish out of the water enough was enough and I didn't go back!

Always get to the beach at Kuta, 200m North of the Soffitel. Look for Joko's bar on the beach. Will organize anything for you. Tours, paintings, beers of course. Tell him Ross sent you.

Having been in Bali 18 times before and being 76 years of age, I still get drawn to this beach scene, whilst my wife and adult daughter spend their time in Kuta Square. To me there seems to be always something that has changed to the scenery..ah yes some things stay the same, the bikini clad girls with the size of whatever they wear reducing by the year. But let us "Not" dwell on this, shall we? I love the vibrant of the place, the sellers trying to sell their wares..art or fake..? You want a cold drink, it doesn't matter what that may be, you got it. To me in general and in the heat of the afternoon, you can't beat an ice cold big bottle of Bintang beer. If you happen to be sitting somewhere, there are always people prepared to get it for you, of course a tip is very much appreciated. The wood work carvings are very intricate, but I can have only that much of it, so I give them a miss. I am very adventurous with trying new food tastes and boys is this the place to have a go. OK..OK.. you may get a nasty "Bali Belly" so you have to pick it carefully. Some prepare it in front of you and those are pretty good as you can see how they handle the food. Roasted corn on the cob in the one hand and a few satay sticks in the other for perhaps 3 or 4 dollars worth beats going to the Matahari shopping Center. But that is not a bad place either! But still for me it is the sea air, the blue sky and turquoise blue sea and YES the sun beating on my back that makes this place an experience. Hope to do it again next time.when I am 77. I think 7 is a lucky number and 77 would be double my luck, see you then Kuta Beach.

Kuta is undenialably one of the most popular beaches and offers fairly good surfs for beginners. However, the overall experience is really affected by all the trash floating in the sea. Additionally the over-eager salespeople just don't leave you alone no matter how clearly you tell you're not interested. Kuta is definitely worth a visit but for me the first visit was also the last one. There are lots of other more pleasant beaches to chill out on.

What can I say about Kuta beach ? It's a must visit. It's the magnet that draws many to this area. It really nice most times of the day (except during the blazing hot noon) and especially during the late afternoon when the sun is setting...
Do leave your precious belongings in hotel room or have someone watch over when you enjoy the activities. There is no seasports like parasailing or jet ski here as it's all conducted at Benoa beach (it's toop choppy here anyway).
Great for people watching, surfing, or just chill out. For more peaceful ambience, go to the Legian or Seminyak area further north :)

Is the best way to describe this beach. Apart from learn surfers swimmers were few and far between. For anyone who has seen any Australian beach the sight of this beach would make your stomach turn. Admittedly credit goes to the local clean up crews who were constantly raking the ongoing tide of debris being washed up on the sand. This beach likely sees better days but today wasn't one of them.

Kuta beach has great sand, with a slightly steep drop off from street level to coastline that lets you pick a good perch almost like sitting in stadium seating to overlook he Indian Ocean. But its not steep at all once you make it to the coastline. The beach slopes VERY gradually once you are in the water, with the ability to go out perhaps 100 meters and still be only chest deep. Great beach for families with little ones to run along the shallows, great for surfing, as they have designated areas. Because of the long and steady slope of the beach under the water, the waves can be pounding out at 50-150 meters and great for surfers, but tame and fun to jump around in up closer to shore. Because of this, you get to watch soccer at the coastline, people wading around in the shallows with tame waves lapping, and people surfing..all in one place. Kuta is just on the other side of the stone wall, so great pizza at pronto pizza on poppies lane, or a walk to the variety of restaurants in the shopping mall are close at hand. If I could change one thing, it would be that those selling their wares along the beach would learn to read who doesn't want to be interrupted. Reading a book or catching some sun still seems to be an invitation to come and try to sell me bead necklaces, ice-cream, etc... Perhaps a better service to sell as a beach vendor is to offer to keep other vendors from interrupting your book every five minutes while you are trying to relax! I would have shelled out some cash for that sort of service!

All Bali hotels will arrange tours, but generally they charge double what you will pay from a tour provider outside the hotel grounds.
Also be aware of "authorised" money changers who set up flimsy stalls in front of, or in the dark recesses of, other shops. Generally they offer a higher rate to suck you in. They are NOT legitimate and WILL CHEAT YOU. Change money only at your hotel, the bank, FED EX stores or Western Union. If you still insist on changing money at an "authorised" money changer, make sure you are the last person to count and handle the money. Still, when you discover you have been cheated, go back with several big friends and tell them you want the police to come sort it out. Good luck with that!

Nice for what it is; a relatively urban-resort beach. The beach itself is expansive, definitely clean enough to swim in, with small waves for early beginner surfers. Downsides: the water is clean enough to swim in but not at all clear, with no coral and virtually no fish, and locals keep asking you if you want surf lessons, so if you walk around you'll hear that every 30 seconds or 10 meters / yards. They mean well enough, its just like the guys on the street asking if you want a taxi or tour every 30 seconds all day long; it gets to be a bit much. I guess it would be really convenient if you wanted a taxi or surf lesson; you'd only need to turn to the guy beside you for it, anywhere, anytime.

Nice big sandy beach. Good waves and surf. Lots of choice to hire surf boards. But be prepared to be pestered to buy everything you can imagine. Gets annoying pretty quickly. You will have to pay if you want to lie in the shade on a sunbed.

Kuta is quite long beach. Popular ? yes , agreed, best to see the sunset and you will get the experience which is hard to explain

But, Kuta beach is not clean, not a nice place to swim, some part is nice, some part are not. the yellow sand, made the beach is not so attractive.

However, some Kuta area is quite nice to sit and relax, especially those nice hotel , such as Kartika Plaza, Bali Padma, Discovery , few other hotel i can recall the name .

There is a nice walking treck behind the beach from Discovery mall , up to around 1km

I've been to Bali a few times but this is my first time on Kuta. I was travelling with friends from Europe and they were constantly harassed by pedlars to buy anything. Tattoos, drinks, towels, sarongs, massages, surfing, manicures, pedicures, hair braiding; absolutely crazy. There is no relaxing here. One woman sat in front of us for almost an hour and I got fed up and chased her off by berating her in Bahasa.

The beach is dirty with all kinds of food trash and so much broken dead corral washing up on the beach. The waves are appropriate for surfing beginners.

And to the ladies, be prepared to be approached, cat called, and even honked at by drivers in cars! Not a moment of peace in Kuta. I've been called "cantik", "piao liang", "huai ni" all day and it was getting on my nerves.

The straw that broke the camel's back was when the boys wanted to go surfing and dragged me along for the ride. Somehow the instructor managed to isolate me from the rest and was constantly asking if I was married or not. Eventually I got tired of him touching my feet when I mounted on the board that I gave up and went back to sit at the beach. He had the nerve to approach me and say "What a pity you have a boyfriend. If you didn't, what about me? *does stupid poses to flex his arms* We could get married and I'd make babies with you everyday. Do you like making babies?"

I am disgusted and this experience has ruined my holiday. Trust that I will never set foot on that damned beach again.

Kuta could easily pass as one of the busiest places in Bali . Given the sheer number of travellers here everything around the place become expensive given the travel crowd. However this place good for sunbathing and a fair amount of surfing . All along the coastline the locals have put up make shift shops were you could sit and sip a cool bottle of beer and relax . too many hawkers asking for you for a massage or nail art becomes annoying after a while . They kinda force you till you avail one of the services . I finally got the nail art done and got a good bargain deal where she had initially Quoted 200,000 and i got it done for 40,000 less that one fourth the prices. The Area around Kuta has KFC and MCd and lovely for shopping .

This place would be good if you are in your teens or a shopping fanatic , but not for a lazy laid back vacation .

The beach at Kuta is quite murky, nice for an occasional swimming but if you are looking for a beach with excellent waters try going to Dreamland of Pandawa beach. They have crystal blue waters there. Local dudes offering under the umbrella set up bar and surfing lesson is quite annoying though as you get stopped every 10 minutes cause everyone wants to try to get you to take lessons with them.

This is a great place to relax and just people watch, however there is a price to pay for peace and quiet if you intend coming back each day.
Pick a favourite drink / chair vendor,buy a few Bintangs and relax. He will protect you from the various traders on the beach if you tell him you are not interested.
Keep coming back to this same spot....You will be welcomed like a long lost rellie, protected and given the best spot on the beach.

Much as Kuta Beach is interesting, it doesn't look at all like the pictures, the sand is a dirty grey colour and the water similar, and in the rainy season often has a lot of debris floating in it which is also washed up on the beach. Aside from that, it's not very relaxing, with the endless shouts of 'massage, massage' 'fruit, coconut drinking' and the hoards of sellers hassling you with their wares - sarongs, clothing, wood carvings to name a few! But hey, if you want some entertainment it can be fun, but you'll need to bargain very hard to get a bargain!

Quite busy with lots of crowds, particularly at sunset. Great beach in some ways - long, wide and flat but so much trash along the water line (tried to pick it up, gave up after 100 m). You will be pestered almost constantly by vendors - renting chairs and umbrellas, selling trinkets, etc.

I think kuta is one of the most famous beach at Bali. Unfortunately, there's not much you can do here other than enjoy the sight.

I went there on my first night to see the sunset. However, I missed the beautiful view since the sun already set. Got back there early in the morning and had a walk around the beach. It wasn't so crowded in the morning but some people did have a walk around too. It was refreshing in the morning.

Unlike other beaches there did not seem to be any water sports but lots of beach chairs where you are asked to sit down and relax and have a drink. One unusual activity is the massages offered by the locals The street alongside the beach is very busy with a string of hotels and shopping on one side and the beach access on the other. You will find all the familiar chains like Starbucks and McDonalds and Marc Jacobs etc. very touristy and commercial with lots of people and busy night and day. Kira is the busiest beach in Bali

We stayed at Grand Inna and frequented the beach right in front of the resort. There are lots of bars scattered along the walkway where the boys seat you and look after you for the rest of the visit. Watch out for the ladies under the trees, they will try and sell you dresses, tees , shorts, manicures pedicures, cut yr eyebrows and shave men's necks, pluck male ears, they are relentless. They do not take no for an answer!!! They come with extremely high prices too. For newbies most tee shirts at fixed price stores range from $3-$5. Their prices are $10 and higher. Dresses are higher than average too. And their services massages etc are very highly priced! Basically they rip their customers off. They won't leave til you buy something or walk away. Better for you all to walk away or basically be rude, which I don't like doing but I've never met a more aggressive bunch of women. Sorry to write such a bad review.

kuta beach is amazing. I would recommend Be-Jo's Bar which is situated near the lifeguards station, opposite the mini market, on the opposite side of the road. Be-Jo was amazing, and took care of our every need. I would recommend the "Radlers". We watched the sunset on several occasion's with Be-Jo, and he provided food and refreshment through out the day.The beach sellers do ask you to buy there goods, but do not give them eye contact and just be polite and they will leave you alone. I would recommend the massage and do have your nails painted but make sure you arranged a price before they start.
The beach is crowded, but this just adds flavour to the beauty of the place. There are a lot of surfers, and so can become crowded on the sea. School children will ask you to complete a survey for them, but this is to improve there language skills, so give them a little of your time. Shower and toilet facilities are provided.

Kuta Beach is clean and has the waves if you just want to body surf. Such a long stretch of beach with plenty of beds and umbrellas you could rent for less than 3USD per hour. Weather was just perfect when we were there last week - blue skies and very hot. We made couple of trips there from our hotel in Jimbaran and then again when we stayed in Kuta itself. Surrounding area, Legian Street and many, many side streets teeming with pubs, and small stores selling local merchandise. So if shopping is your deal, the place to spend your afternoon after you have enough of the waves and sun.

This beach isn't bad, but it was my least favorite beach in Bali. After visiting Canggu and Uluwatu, I saw a lot of surfers trying to catch not-very-good waves. There are also a lot of drunk, obnoxious Aussies running around, so for a romantic getaway or family vacation I suggest skipping Kuta and going to Ubud or straight to Sanur or Canggu.

I spent 3 months living in Kuta, 20 years ago and Kuta beach was virtually empty apart from a few Autralians, surfers and watch sellers.

Kuta beach being the main beach can often times get busy and sometimes dirty but that's only because of the people visiting. Kuta beach is suited to everyone from a shallow beach for the kids between the flags to people who want to relax on a sunbed to surfers. Bars line the sand if you want to cool of to get a drink. A surf board is $5aud to hire approx for as long as you want and the waves are good from experienced surfers to 1st timers

A nice beach, definetly not the nicest but still had an enjoyable time. I knew everyone would ask me to buy everything off them in kuta but I thought id get a break at the beach.

Stopped at a few beach bars like Buhddas bar, always cold beer, lovely sitting in shade watching the surfers. Hawkers are very good at getting you to have a massage and nails done but they do a good job and are cheap. Also talk to them as they are very interesting to chat too.

While Kuta beach is expansive and impressive. It's not what I signed up for in Bali It's a big metropolis. Tons of people. If your into the shopping scene or young party scene Kuta is the place for you. I would just as visit Miami beach ( for a fraction of the price. I'm american) than travel to Kuta. I'll just stick with Sanur tried and true. And bullion home stay. Paradise places in Bali. For me. FYI. If in Kuta visit the memorial site of the bombing incident in 2006.

I've been to a few beaches, and nothing beats Kuta (yet) the beach stretches out to eternity and it is long and wide. The surf is strong and you can really see the large land and sea. The view is magnificent, but it is highly commercialized with the locals trying to sell you almost everything, persuading you to part your money and everything valuable you have on you. They tout, but are not persistent, just walk and enjoy your bubble, they'll leave you alone.

The sunset is beautiful and you can catch it best (IMHO) at Discovery Mall, there you can get everything Kuta is, the beach, the people, the sun, and the planes landing. After catching the sunset you can go back into the mall for food and chilling out.

First thing I noticed this is a crowded beach and I always avoid a crowded place. There are lot of hotels around the beach and thus a lot of people come here to swim as well as to catch the sun. However, I prefer to come here in the night , sit with friends on the beach and catch up on a couple drinks. It's also amazing to see flights landing one after the another as the airport can be viewed from the beach. Ensure you don't litter as you can severely fined by the cops for doing it.

I did not personally like Bali Kita beach as it was full of holiday makers and travellers who just want to get drunk or stoned or both. The only good thing about the beach is that if you surf you will love the waves and it has an amazing sunset. Otherwise it is just a good place to do shopping and to eat out. I was there two nights waiting forma connection flight and will not hurry back in a long while.

The beach is great and it is absolutely beautiful to sit and watch the sunset however it is a bit overcrowded. This also includes endless numbers of street vendor who will come around every two minute trying to sell you something and takes atlest 5-10 minutes before they leave. It gets a bit annoying after some time as you may be busy in enjoying the stunning sunset views..however its still worth it..
Beach also has endless number of bars with chairs out on sand which makes your time even more enjoyable.

We've spent weeks in Amed, Pemuteran so it was a shock to be in such a busy place. The beach has lovely sandy beaches and on the day we visited lovely surf. This must be the busiest place in Bali.

My hotel was right across the street from the beach. I spent quite a bit of time swimming and walking the beach. The waves appeared to be great for surfing which seems to be the main passtime here. The beach was clean, at least no trash laying around.

There were almost no shells or sharp things to step on in the sand. very smooth.

The vendors were not really that annoying. Many would ask you if you wanted to surf or wanted a cold beer, but if you keep moving you are OK.

This isn't a beach for little kids as the waves were pretty big.

Sunsets were quite dramatic over the water.

Kuta Beach has always been mentioned by those who wanted booze, music, sleaze and hanging loose. Having been to Waikiki, Coronando, Al Mazar and Surfer's Paradise, Kuta Beach is off my list. Crowded, dirty, noisy, smelly at certain places and too commercial (touts and hawkers), this beach lacks privacy, enticing and engaging. Come here if you happen to be in the vicinity. I had my lunch at HRC. Bali and Indonesia have nicer beaches. Kuta has diving, snorkelling, surfing and boating activities though. At times I could'nt helped bemused by many, who enjoyed better beaches back home, travelling here with their gear and surf board. I supposed its like the fans of football, cricket, skiiing and pop bands who desires a tick on their visited/did list around the world. To make a special trip just to see Kuta, that's just crazy.

Suitable for those who likes to be friends with other surfers. The beach is overcrowded for me. Although a lot of activities can be done there and lots of pubs and restaurants to chill, unless you are staying nearby, otherwise the traffic to kuta is usually congested. In the evening it is a vibrate place with live bands and party goers. Not a place for me as I prefer a more quiet place to relax.

I found the beach much cleaner than I expected with traders seated near the entrances offering a range of things to buy.
On one day we visited surf life savers were there with flags up advising no swimming. People were still in the water however. This was different to nz, where life guards will advise people to come out of the water.
Traders came along from time to time selling a variety of stuff - bracelets, ice creams, clothes, papers. Most took no for an answer although a couple of ladies were persistent. Nevertheless they fine to chat too.
A good business opportunity would be sunshades and loungers for hire and I believe these are available further north.

If you are looking for surfing paradise so you are in the right place
Kuya beach offers you all what you dream of when it comes to surfing
You can also enjoy the many cafes and restaurants all beach long
But you need to check first the wet or dry season before going to Bali cause in wet season it's very very hot

kuta probably most popular beach on Bali that still attracts huge visitor to come. the beach was nice, sandy and clean. but very crowded visitor and seller which try to offer their business from sunglasses, massage service, until hair do. many surf school use this location.

Kuta beach is a beautiful beach. In dry season almost clean in wett season it can be a little bit full with plastic.
The sea has nices waves, sometimes strong waves. Good spot for surfers.
I like to stroll along the beach. You can walk for miles.
There are enough places were you can sit in the shade and have a drink.
Make sure you use suncream.

Kuta beach is one of the most famous and favourite beaches in Bali. There is a lot of tourist and ofcourse a lot of indonesian people whose are trying to sell you sth every 2 meters.... but they talk with you about price so its ok.. . But the bars and restaurants around are quite expensive... not balinese price.... also there is beautiful beachwalk and great shopping mall.... there is really beautiful sunset every evening and a lot of people

but why i am giving just three points? Its because there are many others beaches i like more and without so many tourist ;-)

We will sadly not be returning to Kuta or Bali with its very aggressive touts and its filthy beaches and filthy Toilets that they will demand money for Having a beer on the beach is good but again you get hassled . The beach was filthy. Covered in rubbish and raw sewage with no evidence that anything is being done about it. Sadly litter generally in Indonesia doesn't seem to be an issue that is being addressed as everywhere I have been has the same problem. I know that we as tourists have a responsibility to do what we can and I hope that most of us do . The extra arrival tax that only Australians Pay does not help I feel if they don't like us why come to this Country. We will be looking at other destinations where we are welcome. I do feel sorry for the descent Balinese we have meet over the years but it has changed.

i visited kuta beach when the volcano erupted so am still not sure if this made a difference. i didnt really hang out there too much but i found it really different.of Of course you will be accosted by locas trying to sell their wares but that is their living. a polite no thankyou doesnt hurt. the sand is average, i found the water average but i didnt go there to swim, more to people watch and sit at a bar called SKINNY MADE bar..... funny local guiy who is just trying to make a living. situated at the end of kuta beach near the green turtle statue. met a few other australians and enjoyed my visit. iv heard you can hire a cabana and umbrella and id say it would be worth it if you are there for a few hours. also the start of the rainy season so weather was hot and humid but very overcast!

A famous beach hence can get bit crowded depending on what time you hit it.

Locals selling food and towels with cut-throat pricing

Transportation is not a problem, taxis, rentals available. There's even horse back rides believe it or not

Very commercialised place.

Tip: Bring your own towel to use, as the locals will try to sell you theirs with hellish prices

Kuta Beach is great for Surfing. If you are not an experienced swimmer you will need to be careful of the strong current. Children should definitely have flotation jackets for safety and not swim out to far. There are sellers on the beach so you can have a massage, pedicure or manicure. It doesn't matter where you go in Bali you will encounter situation where you have to haggle or say a flat out no this beach is no different.

Grab a seat on the beach at a beach bar and enjoy the scenery. There are many places to grab. Drink from. It's hot so an umbrella seat is the best. Beware as soon as you sit down you will be inundated with locals selling their wares. It can be confronting and the Balinese are very touchy freely so be prepared. On the upside you will be able to swing a bargain with a bit of haggling

This beach reminds me of Goa beaches except there is no beds to lie on unless you go further up to Legian beach where you will get ripped off for the beds.The locals sell beer coke etc from cool boxes full of ice and you can sit on their plastic chairs.The beach starts to fil out around 5-30 in the evening when people come to sit and watch sun go down and this is truly wonderful.water is nice to go in amongst big waves but amateur surfers are a pain in the neck.This beach is not as good as Seminyak where you can sit out on bean bags and listen to bands in the evening.

My hotel was 50 meters away from Kuta beach and I visited Kuta Beach almost everyday twice. The beach is ideal for surfing and you will get surfing board on rent from the local shops. I did good swimming in Kuta Beach, it was an excellent experience having swimming on the sea, the water is crystal clear and the waves are not too high so it is safe for children too. Do visit Kuta beach and surrounding area, you will love it like anything. Beach area is usually not accessible after sunset at Kuta.

Definitely a surfers paradise, but not so great for swimming. The giant waves beat you down and throw you around. The beach itself is clean and we sat at Joseph's Bar, highly recommended! The sunset is beautiful and you can watch planes flying in and out all day. You can see the smoke from the Indonesian fires in the distance amoung the mountains. It makes for a relaxing day, but do expect to be constantly bothered by art dealers, massage woman, jewelry, sunglasses, and ice cream sellers. Other than that, enjoy the view!

We shopped madly in kuta art market. Tshirts for Rp20.000, Sarong for Rp 35,000/55.000. Bali bags for Rp20.000. You have to bargain upto 10-15% on what they say!

Visited Kuta beach several times during recent stay in bali.
Beach was clean, waves were good and the weather ideal.
Hired a couple of kabanas with umbrella which was a great investment $5 ph ?
Only negative is the massage ladies and the hawkers which can be relentless don't be tempted to take a foot massage or you will be swooped on to have every other part of your body massages or adorned with bracelets,neck lasses ( there is even a few guys selling bows and arrows???)
Otherwise enjoyable experience.

The beach wasn't as dirty as I expected and the amount of visitors here is still acceptable. The beach is filled with very small shell creatures that hides themselves back into the sand. They pop out of the sand and start moving when you step on the sand near them. It's a very cute sight to see. The beach also has good waves for surfers, also a good place for people to learn surfing. There seems to be too many surf boys trying to sell their service that it can be irritating, just learn how to reject them and you can enjoy your walk down the beach. Most importantly, avoid eye contact with them.

It's so so tacky! It's a constant stream of hassle from beach boys who look intimidating and old women wanting to give massages to anyone who moves! It's very much a young Aussie place for surfing and partying, certainly not for the more discerning traveller. Away from the beach, very much the same tack! Massage parlours,tattoo shops and lots of fake junk shops. If you like that sort of thing then Kuta is the place for you! Surely, this cannot be the real Bali?

The beach is ok, the water is clean, not a tropical water, but the waves are perfect to learn how to surf. The problem are the vendors, they are everywhere. If you spend 3 hours there, the same ice cream guy will pass 25 times. The surf guys are nice and helpful.

With Bali in the news a lot lately due to the ash cloud it reminded me to update my travel review.
I have holidayed in Bali several times now and it occurred to me that there might be travellers out there who have yet to experience life here.
On my last trip in Nov- Dec 2014, I stayed at the fabulous Double 6 Hotel with a view out to sea and as I wrote this review from my balcony, I was watching the planes arrive.
It occurred to me that, regardless of whatever I write, there is a plane arriving every 10 minutes bringing an average of 1200 new tourists every hour into Bali so this place will always be a holiday destination.

My last trip didn’t start so well. I made the mistake of flying Garuda Airlines. They advertised on-board immigration which attracted me to fly with them. But no, this didn’t happen and I still had to join the hour and a half long queue to get through immigration. If you pay the entry fee in US dollars there is no issue, but if you pay in Aussie dollars the fee seems to vary depending on some obscure exchange rate.
Garuda’s on board service is certainly lacking. During the trip to Bali from Sydney the crew didn’t make everyone put up their seats during mealtime (something Qantas crew do). So if you are sitting behind an inconsiderate lowlife that keeps their seat back as far as possible for the whole flight it will be very hard to enjoy your meal. The seats on Garuda seem to recline back further than other airlines which make my decision to travel Virgin or Jetstar even more compelling in the future.

Anyway, now that I am here in the hotel, I have compiled some hints that might help other travellers avoid the pitfalls I have come across here in Bali.
1. If you are approached by the cab or hotel link driver (on the way from the Airport) to take a tour during your stay, don’t commit. They will take you to a number of places including Art Shops, Timber Carvers and Silver Trinket vendors. Their technique is clever. You are greeted at these places by a guide who shows you a couple of locals doing art, or carving or casting metal and explain how they work and produce the items. Next thing you are taken into a shop similar to an aircraft hanger literally full of thousands of items at ridiculously high prices and it is unlikely that any of this stuff is made by locals. Most items can be purchased on the streets of Kuta at much lower prices. If you want to do any tours, book them from the Hotel after doing your own research and work out where you want to go.
2. Speaking of tours, take care booking any tours through the Kiosks on the street. These island stands are full of great tour ideas but chances are you will pay your money and they just won’t turn up. We were able to get our money back but there is no consumer law in Bali, you just have to bluff your way to get a refund. Safe way is to book all tours via your hotel.
3. Under no circumstances pay up front or hand over any money unless you have the goods in hand. Chances are that if you pay and pre-order items like clothing the finished product will be the wrong size, wrong material and wrong colour. We won’t do that again.
4. If approached by a Balinese person in the street who tries to talk to you or hand you a piece of paper, just smile, say “no thanks” and move briskly on. These folks are trying to sell everything from time share to brand knock offs. A current trick they do is to scratch a ticket and show you a winning entry for a free lunch. They will take you to the lunch but then you are pressured into buying a time share for some hotel in the middle of nowhere.
5. The tours to the Monkey Reserve and Elephant Rides are pretty good. Whilst enjoying a ride on an elephant the guide, like most Balinese, will complain about how little they are paid so you are sort of compelled to slip a tip into their hand.
6. On the streets there are a combination of open front shops and glass front shops. The open front shops are run by Balinese who don’t price the items and will follow you around the shop smoking behind you (cigs are so cheap in Bali at $1 packet that nearly every one smokes). They will tell you prices on items but it doesn’t take long to understand they make it up as they go. However, the glass front shops are generally run by Muslims, these shops are clean, air conditioned, non smoking, all items are priced and much cheaper than anything you will get from the Balinese, and the staff stay behind the counter and don’t hassle you. These shops are where we did most of our trinket shopping.
7. Make sure you take in your allowed 1L spirits if this is what you drink. You won’t see much in the way of imported spirits in Bali because the import tax is so high the bars can’t afford to stock them. It is almost impossible to buy JB, JD or JW except in the resorts (but prices are extreme, eg $220 for a bottle of Makers Mark Bourbon, that costs $45 in Oz.) If you drink beer, no problem, Bali Hai and Bitung are cheap. So is Smirnoff ICE Vodka in the 330ml bottles, because I think the Vodka premix bottles are classified same as a beer. Generally the street bars serve homemade spirits, such as Arak, instead of brand names. Cocktails might look cheap but they are low in alcohol and often made from local liquor. In the resorts you can get a JD and Coke but expect to pay around $10 Oz. If you want to party it is cheaper and safer to drink in Oz, than risk the locally made spirits.
8. If you are thinking of hiring a motor vehicle of some sort, keep in mind the laws here are simple. If there is an accident it is the fault of the tourist. This is because if you hadn’t come here the accident wouldn’t have happened. Many insurance policies do not cover you either.
9. Beware buying goods from the beach hawkers. There are signs on the beach advising tourists they can be fined for buying off beach hawkers. Not many tourists know this.

Bali, from Kuta to Seminyak, can be a nice relaxing place put up your feet and can be hassle free once you know the rules of the games they play here.
I hope this information may be of assistance to those planning to travel here.

We stopped at Kuta for the last night in Bali, before early departure in the morning. So, we had just a walk around Pantai Kuta. We arrived at the Kuta beach during the sunset...and the first word that I said was Wow! It's a big beach with a lot of people watching the sunset. You can walk on the foreshore and watch the sunset.

It wasn't too busy when we went there at around 2pm. The beach is an excellent sport to surf, especially for beginners. Lessons are available and there are plenty of places where you can buy food and drinks from. There was a Balinese ceremony taking place on the beach while we were there, so it made our stay even more interesting.

Kuta seems to be cleaning itself up since my last visit five years ago, although still busy, the streets are cleaner, as is the beach itself, there's just too many hawkers there trying to constantly sell you junk, that it becomes very annoying, stay only just to say you went there, many other nicer beaches.

Kuta Beach is much like much of Kuta itself, lots of tourists and not very clean. Surfing lessons are available as well as surfboard/boogieboard rentals along with food and drink vendors everywhere. Hawkers here can get alittle annoying, you just have to be insistent on not wanting to buy something. Beach chairs (chairs though and not lounge chairs) are available at the top of the beach at the edge of the treeline for rental, can run about Rp 100.000 for 2-3 hours but you can bargain it down lower. The beach itself is not the cleanest, water gets alittle rough too so not a good spot for small kids to swim. Ok for sitting out for abit and probably gets good sunsets, otherwise it's not a must-see.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,394,20>===============  
i personally do not like this beach. The locals are just so annoying, trying to sell you all kind of stuff, you are not allowed to stay in the shadow, as is their place, but they sell you a umbrella.
Kuta is not Bali...Bali is wonderful, nice people, very friendly, helpful.
I just can notice, that the beaches are all over cleaner in Bali thant 4 years ago. They are really trying to do something for this planet.

Please keep bali clean and refuse plastic bags in any supermarket.

I normally love walking along beaches especially in the morning or evening. Unfortunately this was less than enjoyable at Kuta beach as my girlfriend and I were bombarded with beach vendors trying to sell everything from massages to ice creams to places to sit.
The sand itself was covered in litter, mostly plastic and cast away coconut shells from cocktail drinks.
There were lots of people enjoying the surf, mostly Australians. The beach road is a one lane, one way road that is constantly blocked with traffic.
A great many bars, restaurants and bars line the coast road here including the inevitable McDonalds, KFC, Starbucks, 7/11 etc. There is also a Hard Rock Hotel and Restaurant.
Nightlife is loud and brash. Most bars are fairly empty but some trendy places were full and lively until past two a.m.

Kuta beach is a grey sand beach, hence it is hard sand. It is good to be here somewhere around sunset. Watch the sunset, grab a beer and enjoy the view. This place remains very crowded at all times.

Me and my friend came to Bali to relax and enjoy the beach, sun and the sea.
It's not the other tourist that are annoying but all the selling. Literally every five minutes somebody was trying to sell us something, one women actually woke me up. So went to Seminyak beach after 3 hours and had a relaxing afternoon without interruptions.

For a couple of bucks you can get surf lessons and rent boards and have a beer as a west coast sunset sinks into the sea.

No, it's not an Aussie beach. But it is consistent surf without sharks. And old mate waiting with a cold beer at the end. Don't like it? It probably doesn't like you.

Busy beach...always things happening. Great for the amazing Bali sunsets...thousands flock here for this summer view making the beach an entertaining focal point.

We would sit on the beach vendor provided chairs and chill away the time with a bintang and short..of required. And you didn't need to get up for a refill!

Prices were ok..20 to 30 k for a bin tang...ok price by me! If the seasonal timing was right you could always walk to the road and see a procession of Harley Davidson or other attractions going up the jalan pantai kuta....

Waves are great..and you can watch the surfer boys doing their stuff in the day..or just get yourself battered by the breakers which is fun.

If wanting food, a 1uick jaunt across the road has all you need.

The water is amazing. The beach is clean with rental lounge chairs every where and drink service. The beach is pretty clean and it's nice to just sit and soak in the sun while watching people. Walk on the beach and enjoy the warm, clear water. Surfing lessons and board rentals also offered at the beach.

We had a day in Kutalots of shops to see which was great if you want to do some shopping but my god the people hassling you to buy things is incredible so much that I couldn't even shop to start ignoring them and walk away which I felt I was being rude. They chase you down the street that when if you alone. Then me and my husband wanted to have a nice quiet beer on the beach what a mistake then you get people hassling you on the beach to buy things even when you refuse they sit next to you and refused to go. It was so unpleasant and we went through some quiet streets to find a nice quiet restaurant they even approached us in the restaurant when we said we were trying to eat they sit outside and watch us eat and continue to hassle is to Buy something. Will never go to Kuta again

It's an ideal beach for surfing and swimming. Even if you don't know swimming , you can still walk a kilometre inside the sea. Kids really loved this beach. It is good for running and walking.

It's a prefect place to watch sunset with a Bintang !!

I wouldnt want to say that Kuta is fantastic, magnificent, extraordinary those kind of things. Because it is definitely not that. But, it is not bad either. Kuta is just a regular beach that has its own character. If you go to Kuta after 10 am, that's definitely would not allow you to see Kuta differently. But, go there just right after the sun rise, around 7, take a walk, embrace the cool morning crisp air, and believe me, you would definitely fall in love with Kuta.

We first visited Kuta beach in 2004 when there was only a few of those beer sellers on the beach, now there are many dozens. The one that we spent the most time at was Ketuts Bar,opposite the grand istana rama hotels driveway.You can clearly see what attracted surfers to Bali originally with that continuous rolling wave set all along the beach.The many vendors offering constantly their wares, spoils what would be a perfect end to the day with a couple of Bintangs watching the sunset.

Great for surfing; one of the hotspots in South East Asia with plenty of beginners and experts mixing. Nearby street is lined with generic fastfood joints, tattoo parlors and overpriced clothing shops, it lacks any sort of charm or Indonesian feel.

The beach itself is rather average, especially by Bali standards. My main memory will be being hassled by hawkers (at least once every five seconds!) once entering, a real annoyance.

Kuta beach perhaps is the most famous beach in Bali. It is long and wide beach with a good wave for surfers. There are many vendors that offer food, drinks, surf lesson, tattoo, nail art, massage and lots more. A lot of people come to Kuta to relax and watch the sunset. The beach is more crowded during sunset.
The place is also very photogenic for photographers. Many spots for nice view are found here.
The beach is not really clean, because it is very crowded. If you come to this beach, please make sure you do not leave any garbage behind
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,399,40>===============  
Pick your place to sit and have a well earned drink at the end of the day to watch the sunset and close on another day in Bali. You wont need to move chairs as the vendor and massage people bombard you with souvenirs but a polite "no thanks" will generally do the trick but some more than others, Remember this is how they survive and earn a living... Sit back and snap a couple of photos while taking in what the beach of Bali has to truly offer.

It was my first time that I've actually spent about an hour and half walking along the Kuta Beach starting from the PANTAI KUTA signage. From this starting point, i can see the whole stretch of beach with so many holiday makers from Australia, European countries all seated along the beach drinking, laughing and relaxing at the beach, having a wonderful time. There were private vendors selling drinks, beer and ice cream, etc
Activities that I've saw include the Balinese women trying to sell the T'shirts, accessories, doing manicure, pedicure and also massage sessions on the sandy ground with a piece of sarong laid beneath them.
As I walked along, I came across two couples from Australia, the senior being an Italian born retiree staying in Australia and wife and daughter with her husband a miner. Striked a conversation with them and understand that they worked hard and each year took a 10 days break to come to Bali for their holiday. Marvelled at them for knowing to spend their time relaxing at the beach.
Kuta is also famous for the surf activities. You can rent the surf board from the local operators found along the stretch of beach. Watch the waves roaring in with the surfers moving along with the waves.
I hope i could one day find time to relax at the Kuta Beach like them and watch the activities goes by ...

Kuta Beach is a favorite for surfers from all over the world. You will always find this place bustling with people. Clean waters and good waves make it attractive for people. Located very close to the main market of Kuta, it offers a lot of options post your beach meanderings.
Surfing is the only water sport you can enjoy at this beach. Make sure you haggle as much as you can if you're looking for n instructor, (IDR 200000 or lower for a one hour lesson would be a standard price that all trainers will charge)
If you're looking to beat the rush, go there early morning.

When in Bali we always go to a bar on the beach just in front of the large turtle, called Hanns & Tonys Bar. We have been going to Bali for a number of years now and always enjoy there company, along with all the ladies selling there goods. Nice to sit there with a drink and watch the sunset, probably one of the best places to watch the sunset to be honest.

We love going to the beach at sunset. Walk across the road from poppies1 lane and there is a young man(cant remember his name) with 'tn'on the back of his chairs.

A very big and busy beach with lots of vendors constantly asking if you want to buy something, but they don't hang around or pester you when you say no. I don't surf but there were plenty of people on surf boards who seemed to be having a good time.
We went down to watch the sunset and it was just beautiful. There are plenty of restaurants nearby where you can see it from but nothing beats sitting on the sand and just watching with everybody else.

The most famous beach in Bali, but this was a pretty disappointing experience. Some much better beach experiences in Bali (even just walking a few hundred metres from here). Can get very crowded & the often 'in your face' hawkers of everything is just a draining and frustrating experience. It is good for 'party' groups perhaps, who want to enjoy a beer with a group of friends, but for a more relaxing breach time try elsewhere.

Not my kind of beach. We were hassled from the time we we arrived. One woman sat at my wife's feet for best part of an hour trying to convince her to have a manicure and another kept on coming back to push her t shirts and other clothes. Another one came up behind us and started rubbing her shoulders. Then there was the ice cream sellers, hats, etc etc, even a fake bow and arrow. We came back another evening to watch the sun set which was nice, but noted the rubbish that had been left by the day's sun worshippers.

Walking along Kuta beach is a great experience, you meet some characters local and tourist, plenty of places to stop for a Bintang and great views across the ocean.

The beach is safe and so is the water. There are vendors continuously wandering along trying to sell trinkets but you need to barter well to get prices down to reasonable, they will rip you off if you're too easy on them. Remember that they will not sell items at a loss so keep prices low by starting your first bid very low.

I really enjoy going to Kuta beach sitting at molybar (which is opposite hard rock) having either a cold bingtang or soda or getting surfing lesson having a laugh with the locals going down late afternoon to be there for the sunset listening to music or singing-while someone is playing the guitar. There is a strong chance you will be mobed by the women selling clothes,massage, bracelets and just about every thing else this can be annoying but just be strong in saying no you don't have to be rude just say no thankyou take it for what it is they are just trying to make a living .

I stayed in a hotel which is just 5 min to the beach, when I had nothing to do, I came here, take a nap under the trees, it's very comfortable, no insect to disturb you, and the temperature is not too high because of the breeze. And the sunset here is very beautiful.

Kuta is a great hotspot for tourists. However, it is definitely not the best beach Bali has to offer. If you're looking for a general beach experience then Kuta is not that bad. It's also located close to most hotels. However, if you prefer cleaner beaches and a more private experience I would suggest looking elsewhere.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,402,40>===============  
Maybe Kuta became popular because of its beach. The beach is very beautiful especially on sun set time. Every first visitor to Bali may have visited this beach. The beach front area is now very crowded with buliding, hotels, restaurants, and shops.

A walk down Kuta Beach you can see the future of Bali, there is construction all around you, the palm trees are disappearing and more big buildings are taking over, the rubbish on the beach was being cleared, however there were plastic bags in the water, ice cream wrappers etc, I find this so sad as I still remember the beach forty years ago, and I do understand its progress and nothing stays the same. I just wonder when it will stop. So my review of Kuta Beach is ... Don't come just for the beach.

Kuta Beach is unique and it would have been lovely to either enjoy a walk on the long sandy stretch or lay a mat to sit down to just take in breeze and watch the surfers ride the waves. But all this is not to be as you will find vendors coming to you ever so often to either convince you to take up surfing lessons, rent a sun deck chair or purchase some Bainese souvenirs from them. While I can appreciate that everyone is trying to make a living, it takes the joy out of relaxing at the beach. We essentially stayed away from Kuta Beach after one attempt and did not bother to return.

The beach is wonderful. However a huge caution about changing money in the hotels / money changers here. They cheat you in two ways - [1] They offer 50K IDR notes. The exchange rate is 13800 IDR to a dollar. You have to count a large number of notes. By the time you realise that the number of notes they have given are wrong, they disappear. [2] when you convert back, they give you USD of earlier than 2006 vintage that is not exchanged by banks. Please be careful.

Very busy place. Don't go if you want to relax on a beautiful beach. You will get hassled all day and you get tired of saying no thank you. The beach itself doesn't compare to our beautiful beaches in Australia, however it is a must see place while in Bali. Even if you go in the late afternoon and set a baby turtle free, that is a great experience!

There is two things about Kuta Beach you either like it or hate it. it is a great place to sit at one of the many drink stand along the beach front they offer you chairs and you can buy beer ,soft drinks and cruisers the only down side is all the people try to sell you just about anything if you just want to buy anything its fun bartering the price then after you have bought of someone they then all say why you not buy from me its great fun.You can get massages Nails done Toes done Braided Hair but the best one is they ask you if you want the Garden trimmed well it mean they want to pluck the Hair from your ears no joking.Having been to Bali for many years my wife and I go down to watch the sunset that's when it gets busy as lots of people go down to watch sunset we enjoy talking to people from all over the world and locals as well its a must do thing if you go to Bali.

People say I'm crazy, but actually Kuta is my favourite part of Bali. It's where you can meet Indonesians from Flores, from Java, from Sulawesi, from Sumatra and from every other province imaginable. They all flock to this tourist mecca for work, usually to send money home to their families. As well as Indonesians, Kuta Beach is the meeting place for tourists from all over the world - at least the first time they visit... :) Because of this, if you are open to smiling and saying hi to everyone, you will learn so much about other cultures and peoples. This is my favourite thing about Kuta. But there's much more. It's one of the nicest places to swim, surf and watch the sunset. There are amazing places to eat and the beers are always cold - served with lots of smiles - and sometimes a song..... go to the little beach bars opposite the Stone, for a mix of Balinese and Sumatrans - and keep smiling!!

An average beach, good place to learn surfing. There are bars / shops / cafes across the beach. There are little ponies along the stretch of the road beside the beach. Hop on if you feel lazy to walk under the hot sun! Expect locals to sell you hats/scarf/tatoo and massage services along the beach. They are friendly, reject them politely if you are not keen. However if you are interested to get any services/products, be sure to ask them to sell you at a good price!

Nice water. Nice beach.
It is however too crowded, lots of litter, too many people approaching you to buy their products or services. You cant just sit and enjoy the beach without getting harassed every 2 minutes.
It is also a shame that the beach is full of ciggie butts. In fact, we even saw a diaper get washed up. Ugh!

If you have the money, go to a quieter area. If you are on a budget, then it is just fine.

Lovely beach with awesone locals to sell you anything you may need or not need lol. Hawkers can be annoying but be firm and polite when declining. Most are good fun and take jokes for fun. They could use your business giving you a pedicure for cheap cheap $$ to feed their family. All good pedicure good value for money. You only live once.

Before arriving I was worried that this beach would be a horrendous tourist trap but I was pleasantly surprised, it is a little overcrowded at times and you do get heckled a little but it is nothing compared to other south East Asian countries. The surf is usually pretty good and you can enjoy a nice beer courtesy of the friendly locals who set up shop there. Will definitely go back!

Kuta is one of the most iconic place in Bali. The beach was clean with white sands and many malls around the beach. The beach also offer a good wave for a surfer. But for me, Kuta is too crowded for vacation in Bali. Although in Kuta we can reach many places around the beach easily but for vacation I think it's not to enjoyable.

Visited Kuta beach several times while on holiday in Kuta. Its good for swimming, surfing and laying on the beach. The sunsets are also great. Its a very long beach and there are food and drink outlets everywhere. There are also surfboards for hire and surf lessons from many places.

We picked Rudy's. Nicley shaded by the trees. Great guy no hassles. Beers and coolers were cold always appeared just when you needed a replacement. We were lucky to see the release of baby turtles into the ocean at sunset and the sunset was beautiful. Hawkers were constant but not a hassle - No thanks and they moved on.

The best part of Kuta Beach is its close to all the action, but that also means there is a peak hour rush at sunset - when everyone wants to get down there. A good alternative is to get up for sunrise and go for a walk - its less crowded and not as hot - so more romantic.

Hire a seat with an umbrella - doesn't cost much and saves you getting cooked by the sun. The humidity can make you think you aren't getting burnt - but you are!

Being in Bali for the first time, I wanted to try surfing and I had the best experience learning it there.

I got to know a local who knows another local working at the surf school and I can only say, Balinese are one of he friendliest people in the world.

I think that to learn how to surf, you need a good teacher. My friend got a teacher who was not giving him a 100% and when he tried to surf himself, he couldn't quite do it. We went for a second lesson with my teacher David and he really gave us his 100% when teaching us.

If you need to look for David, his shop is called Marroan which is directly opposite boardwalk shopping mall in Kuta.

Left this place with the perfect memories and would definitely return with friend who are interested in learning surfing too.

This beach have a few swimmers but I wouldn't recommend it for swimming because the waves are strong. Good for sunset watching. Better if you are watching it sitting on a board.

Apply sunscreen as much as possible.

Kuta Beach is perfect for surfing all day and for enjoy a romantic sunset, drinking a cocktail comfortably laid down on sofas in one of front sea bar and cafe there. Beach is very big and you will never find it too much busy and it's really close to many shops and restaurants. Once in Kuta it could happens that you lost and find yourself in this beach..all the roads goes to the main beach in Kuta.

This beach would be great for surfers, and sunbathers alike, but be prepared for an onslaught of salespeople walking the beach. They are relentless so you'll need to be firm, not rude, but firm. Make sure to hit this beach for sunset & don't be afraid to grab a drink from one of the guys under the umbrellas so you can take advantage of their customer seating.

The beach is dotted with surfers and locals selling surf lessons and overpriced canopies on the beach. The beach itself is good and is fun with waves for surfing. Relatively clean, though not pristine. Worth a visit for fun and frolic, but not quite exquisite.

atmosphere of the beach is always crowded in the domestic and international tourists visit .
but from year to year is far more note about the cleanliness , but bad for tourists domestic entirely visible not have rules and discipline of cleanliness ranging from throwing cigarette butts , plastic bottles of drinks , to spit and vomit at any place, should as a fellow of the Indonesian nation must helped keep the land assets . but sorry I value my consciousness because this is just a dream to be able to appreciate and be an example to the other. trip advisor and turism agencies must give warning and local pemeritah should provide a deterrent effect before bad habits become culture

Beautiful beach to hang out for the day. Lots of people, surf lessons and lots of shopping and restaurants nearby.

The name is Kuta Beach. Accommodate with many small bars and night life. You'd once forget that this is Indonesia.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,408,40>===============  
It is a huge beach, in the area where most of the night life is! Besides enjoying the sun, sand and sea, you can have a cold beer (someone will sell you one, no need to go get it) and have surf lessons! Unfortunately, there is too much garbage. The garbage is collected and piled up in some areas of the beach, but you will still find a lot of garbage in the sand and water. It's a shame and a sad situation.

I stayed in a hostel at kuta beach for a week and learnt surfing. There are a lot of different surfing school and the waves are great for beginners. The beach and water is pretty packed by tourist. If you want less people around you you should go more south.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,408,40>===============  
Great for surfing, wading and watching the sunset.
Not a place for a peaceful laze on the beach. There are locals selling there wares and services which can be annoying if you don't know how to deal with it. The pop up bars are great for a drink and watch the beach activities. But my favourite activity is the release of the baby turtles in the early evening. See Bali Sea Turtle Society website for further details. A truly wonderful experience.

The beach is a little crazy and gets crowded...but that's the bali experience...Grab a seat and a beer...be pampered...or just sit back and enjoy watching the sun go down...we were amazed as to how busy the beach area is...and we never saw any problems...and save the turtles project?...To watch the crowd get invovled was fantastic...

It was all I had expected and more.
Crowded, hawkers, pretty big surf etc.
Didn't expect the beach to be so hot you can't walk on it (Sanur is cooler as the sand is more golden).
The surf itself is a straight break so if you can surf it is probably pretty boring - just a short dump really.

We walked from Kuta down to Seminyak - crowded and a bit boorish really, once was enough.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,408,30>===============  
The beach is pretty nice and you can easily rent sunbeds and surfboards. You can easily buy soft drinks from the sunbeds which is in the same price range as at the restaurants or supermarket. Most of the sellers are nice, but we had some nagging us for about 30-40 minutes which was annoying. Tried to tell them we didn't want anything, but they did not listen. This is the reason why I only gave the beach a 3/5 rating.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,408,40>===============  
We (a couple) had a chance to visit this beach several times and none of them was related to swimming.

This is a great place to observe sunset, especially if it is cloudy because of surreal colors of the sky after sunset. It is also a great place to have a long barefoot walk because of quite long length of this beach. You can even have a chance to drive on bicycle half way through the beach starting from the airport. Finally, you can always surf there if you aren't aftaid to break yourself. But what you won't be able to do for sure is to swim because of gigantic waves that make 90% of surfers to drop.

Another minus is that it is very crowdy by both locals and tourists.

All in all, you definately won't be able to skip it if you are in Kuta. But if you are not, don't come here unless you have other plans besides calm swimming.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,409,20>===============  
If you're used to white sand beaches then you may well be sorely disappointed by Kuta Beach. On this visit there seemed to be some reasonable effort made to clean up the garbage, but it still didn't look particularly clean and I certainly wouldn't want to spend any time actually lazing about on the beach or swimming. A quick look is sufficient before you try other places in Bali.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,409,30>===============  
I have heard it all before...its dirty, non descript, full of hawkers and people wanting to sell you something, the sky is often not clear etc etc. I have spent a day on it...walking from south Kuta to Seminyak and along the path alongside it and back down Jalan Legian. I like it. It is full of life, ordinary life, people make their living off it, kids go down after school, ordinary folk go there to cool down, play, fly kites, hold ceremonies etc.

When I was there in January the beach wasn't actually that crowded and was quite pleasant, though nothing special to look at. There were great waves for surfers, and also many cheap places to eat along the beach.

The beach is a little crazy and gets crowded but that's the bali experience. Grab and seat and beer and watch the sun go down

If you are interested in sun bathing, this is not the place.

If you want to surf altered with sun bathing, meet people, enjoy the nice view of the beach etc this is the place!

Surfing is great (mostly pre 13:00 as far as I understood). Surf boards can be hired very cheap. Surf lessons are provided by local people and there is people renting surf borads every 20 meter at the beach. The prices differs and some can be totally rip off while some are cheap. Try to negotiate with the price and go to several different people before deciding where to settle down.

You can hire sun chairs with umbrellas. This can be recommended if you want to relax sometimes at the beach. Prices here as the same above, some people take crazy much but if you set a lower price they usually go with it.

The beach would get a 5 rating if it wasn't for all the people going around selling stuff all the time, everything from ice cream pineapple, bows and arrows, hats, bracelets etc. They ask if you want to buy something and even if you say no they sometimes sit down in front of you starting to ask you questions about your name, where you are from, what hotel you stay at etc and then continue with a selling approach again.

If sunset is amazing but a bit overcrowded. Definitely worth a visit though!

Food is available through the restaurants at the Kuta beachwalk and nearby streets which shouldn't be more than a couple of minutes walk from the beach.

Everyone who told me about Bali told me to stay away from Kuta because of how overcrowded it has become. They were sooo right. The minute you set foot on the sand packs of vendors run towards you as if you are the last piece meat on a table. It was actually very uncomfortable for some members of my party. We laid out for a bit, but quickly left to Dreamland beach.

Kuta beach is very busy with lots of surfers, not many swimmers. We found the sand was a bit on the dirty side, not sure if it was from the volcanic ash that had been disrupting travel prior to our visit. Kuta beach gets very busy late in the afternoon with lots of locals and tourist going to watch the sunset. Lots of street venders/hawkers selling their wares, so be prepared to get harassed a bit if visiting late in the afternoons.

Kuta sea beach offers a beautiful natural setting for the tourists. It is a bit overcrowded and you will find a lot of hawkers constantly disturbing you. The sea here has good waves for surfers to enjoy their outing there. The beach is excellent for the outdoor activities. To me, the best thing in this beach would be to buy a drink from the hawker and get a sit under the shade in the beach to relax for a while. You will love to watch the sunset from the beach as it presents an awesome serene sight for the viewers. All in all, a fantastic place to be and you will surely love it there.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,411,50>===============  
The sand wasn't as fine or white as I thought it would be, but still walkable barefoot without risk of injury. There are countless mobile stands, each fronted by a tan, tattooed man offering to teach you surfing lessons. Surfing boards provided. If you don't want to surf, like I did, you can buy a drink from them and they will provide you with a UPRIGHT plastic chair. Not the best position to get an even tan. I'm curious as to why they don't have deckchairs. So if you want to tan properly, bring a beach towel.

Otherwise, the beach is excellent. Not very crowded.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,411,40>===============  
The stretch of Kuta & Legian beach is probably the most busy in Bali. The tides are strong with plenty of options for surfers. There are also plenty of surfing tutors available at this beach.

Kuta beach is a surf beach, and if you really want to surf you need to actually know the tides and when it's a good place to surf. When I went it was mostly kids wading up to their waste and beer vendors. I stopped by the beach one night and after walking for 20 minutes, stopped and grabbed a beer. The guy who manages this particular umbrella/ cooler brought me a plastic chair, an empty crate for my feet, and another as a side table. The redneck recliner was one of the highlights of my trip, since it felt so foreign yet familiar.

Good for those who love to surf.
The sand is very hot, i can't go to the ocean barefooted.

I have been to Boracay Philippines, this is no bias but it is better there. Total different.

But as I said Surfer Lover will love the place.

Kuta Beach is open for public and it shows its beauty naturally. People can do surfing for the beginner until the expert one. The wave in this beach is awesome and everybody feel free to have memorable experience there. Recommended one to visit.

This is one of the busiest beaches on the west coast of Bali, only metres from the busy shopping precinct of Kuta Square. There are vendors on the beach where you can barter for goods...There are also numerous bars ( large eskies) with seating and a variety of tourists relaxing and waiting for sunsets, possibly some of the best sunsets photographed. There are also several surfing schools as the waves are medium sized and perfect for beginners....in the evening just before sunset there is a cool westerly breeze which makes relaxation after a hot day bearable....After sunset there are numerous local teenagers defying the law and letting off fireworks ( police turn a blind eye to appease the tourists).. Kuta beach has so much more to offer that the dull eastern side of the island...

Kuta is a very touristy commercial operation , lots of touts for anything you may desire but mainly tacky junk. on the stalls and street.
lI would suggest the Discovery Kartika Plaza for shopping, it has most kinds of shops from food to clothes and jewellery or that treasured memory item, prices are better than Australia (WOULD NOT BE HARD) . TIP check with your travel agent to avoid any schoolies week from Australia, unless you enjoy being overrun with cheap booze fuelled teenagers running amok. The better class up market hotels is also a great way to avoid the party set as they tend to drift to the budget accommodation to save their money for the party life. TIP 2 avoid hiring scooters the traffic is chaotic the accident rate is high and taxis are cheap, much safer, also can take you to other interesting locations easily to enhance your stay.
Tip 3 LADIES, NEVER leave your drink unattended or turn your back on it drink spiking is common in most Asian holiday destinations .
But with common sense Bali can be a great holiday spot just respect yourself and the locals to give you the best possible holiday and a place you want to come back to

Bali is a great place to for chilling and relaxing - best know for beautiful beaches and night life and late night parties
We went to Bali in the month of July - temperature were hovering around mid 20 degrees. Sunny in the afternoon with very less chance of rain but you never know as its an island - it can rain anytime.
There is no direct between India and Indonesia so we took Malindo Air which had a halt in Kuala Lumpur.
We made our hotel booking and air tickets through make my trip and got some discounts as well.
A week long trip is enough the explore the island of Bali.
The most famous beach of them all is KUTA.
Known for surfing and high tides.
We went there couple of times in the afternoon to have a chilled lemon beer (popular) may be read a book and then take a dip in the water.
In the night - most popular night club - Sky garden Lil expensive but worth it - starts rocking from 10pm till 5am in the morning on the weekends.. Sometimes celebrity singers make an appearance as well.
It has 3 floors.. And it gets crowded.. But the atmosphere is worth experiencing.
Even the Sanur area at night is pretty good for late night stuff..
There is a volcano in Bali which has a breath taking view from the restaurant we had a buffet lunch.. Great for #selfies.
There are also some adventure sports like white water river rafting and scuba diving which are must for a adventure sports lover.
All in all - Bali is peaceful serene place to visit.
Enjoyable for both couples and bachelors.
Budget - less than Rs. 1 lac per person for a week long trip.

If you're staying around Kuta, the beach is within walking distance. Good thing is no hotels are built on the beachfront, so it's usually not crowded.
The surfs not that high, perhaps you need to come back a few times to get the right tide. Beach is wide, clean. You can laze on rented deck chairs, while someone comes over to braid your hair, do your nails or massage for a small fee. They serve nice cold bottled tea, out of nowhere.

From the hawkers to the Bintang on offer this beach is the ideal place to rewind from at the end of a busy day of shopping !
We like the drink vendor across the road from Kuta Seaview Hotel. Where you will be welcomed with a deck chair to sit back and enjoy your drink watching the beautiful sunsets only Bali, the sense of paradise could offer .

My first visit to ball in 2011 I came here, I thought I would be less hassled walking to our destination on the beach than walking through town, boy I was wrong, hair braiding, surfing lessons, ice cream was all on offer alternating as we went along. I swam here and found my feet and legs tangled with all kinds of rubbish in wave breaks - disgusting. I visited again in September 2015 and where we chose to enter was a mistake as we're basically pounced on with the same things on offer as mentioned in 2011 except now a chair and shade. I definitely wasn't swimming again after my last experience either. A short visit to see the view and back to the hotel pool!

Kuta has everything. From the morning waves to the night vibes. It's the heart of Bali. My best time to enjoy is morning time when sand and sun are warming up.

Of course this is the most famous beach in Bali... You can stroll along the waterline for many miles, the beach seems to go on forever! Also great for sunset watching, beer in hand...On a previous visit the year before the beach was really dirty, but I guess it was rainy season and lots of garbage and debris had washed up on the shore

If you game for surfing this is the beach where you get to learn how to surf. Sand on the beach is not as nice as those found at nusa dua.

Long row of shops, shopping centers, restaurants and hotels are fronting this Kuta beach but across the road.

You will see horse carriages in front of Hard Rock Cafe where it will ride along this road fronting the beach and will turn one round back to where you started.

We've spent many days watching the sun go down over Kuta Beach with a nice cold beer. It's a very social thing as most people are happy to talk and exchange information about Bali, and other parts of the world. Sometimes you even get to see a Bali red sunset.
Different parts of the beach are more popular than others, the closer to the airport you get the less options you have. Main Kuta is busy but you can always get a seat.

Kuta Beach is a long strip of sand on Bali's east coast in the southern town of Kuta. It is pretty much the closest beach to the airport. Planes flying over the sea from the west are fascinating to watch from a beach. Kuta is a sandy beach with quite a large drop between the finer sand at the top and the compact water-logged sand that runs alongside the sea.

Kuta Beach slightly after peak season was surprisingly not too busy. It does not seem the most promising of beaches given Kuta's reputation and the proximity to the airport. It is a nice enough spot though. It is not exactly a beautiful beach, hardly the kind of place to take breath away.

Surprisingly Kuta Beach is cleaner than many in Indonesia. For some reason it does not suffer the detritus that ruins so many of Indonesia's sand features. There are of course hawkers in the area.

The sea is relatively busy so not really for gentle splashing.

A nice enough beach in a heavily commercialised area.

SIMPSONS BAR in front of the big turtle was the best place on the beach, Simpson was an excellent host and bar person, charismatic and cheery, nothing was too much for him. Was a great atmosphere amongst the locals selling their wares and the other tourists while watching the sun set over the ocean, we will be back next year! The best place on the beach for sure!

It's impossible to go 5 minutes without someone asking if you want a massage, pedicure, manicure, hat, kite, etc. And when you say no, they will stand or sit next to you and repeatly ask every minute, hoping maybe you've changed your mind. Sometimes even massaging your shoulder when you say no. I understand that this is how they make a living, but this is not the way to get business. After being harassed to buy something after the millionth time, we had to get off the beach.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,416,30>===============  
like vegas its good for a few days but after that it becomes obnoxious. Touts and drunken aussies are the rule of the day. Seminyak is somewhat less obnoxious.....I wanted to get a t shirt saying "no I don't need an fn cab". Unfortunately the beach is filthy. You'd think they could get a machine to clean up all the garbage. I only visited restaurants that cleaned the beach in front of their establishments.

That being said the night life is pretty lively.......but wears thin pretty quick.

Every time I visit Bali I have to have a swim in the ocean. Some days the water is a little untidy but that has never stopped me. People dislike some of the hawkers but they are so polite if you are the same. Nothing wrong with a beer after a good swim.

Kuta Beach is a popular beach destination in its own right, with tourists from all over the world, swimming, surfing or sunbathing by the beach. The hawkers will sell you soft drinks and beer, snacks and other treats, and you can rent surfboards, lounge chairs and umbrellas. The hawkers are a bit intrusive and they would come to you every 10 minutes to sell their items. The locals can teach you how to surf with a fee.

My trip to Kuta Beach was okay. I had better experience though in other places. Ones with nice white, powdery sand and blue clear water. I'd have to commend though the people. Very nice and accommodating. I traveled alone but had fun mingling with the locals. I also had the first taste of surfing. Didn't know how to swim. Instructor was patient enough to push the board until he sees a good wave then let me paddle a bit back to the shore and made me stand up. Good times!

Food stalls by the beach? Don't get fooled. Some locals told me that they charge non-locals more so be careful.

Beach was also near the shopping area, Hard Rock, and Starbucks.

Went to view the sunset . Pestered by vendors to buy. No big deal ,but awkward saying no thankyou with the persistence trying to make you buy. Mostly they were polite and went on their way with a grin. Inadvertently sat on chairs that we found out later we should pay for . Only rested for a while ,but whilst the traders were polite,felt that the beach chairs should be marked for hire ... But atmosphere was great ,the sunset spectacular .

Due to its proximity to the airport and the long sandy beach, Kuta is mostly a surfer's destination. I had heard bad reviews about it and I wasn't expecting anything special but I happened to find it better than expected. I did the cheapest shopping in Bali, I could eat cheap Balinese food in sieways where locals eat and found a great hostel. I met lots of fellow travellers, so I have a good impression of the place.

My flight was leaving at 1:25 am Saturday so I was trying to look for something low key to do near the airport. My driver/guide suggested this outing. It was worth catching the sunset at Jimbaran and hanging out at Kuta during a film festival! The place is very busy and touristy, though, that's how come it only gets a four vs five star from me. I'm glad I didn't stay here the whole time. Candi Dasa is the way to go if you want to get away!

We were staying in a Villa nearby and walked to the beach to watch the sunset. It was truly beautiful to watch the sunset over the Indian Ocean. Perhaps because of the time we went we were not approached by even 1 hawker to buy anything. The beach had lots of people walking and waiting for the sunset as well.

We new that sunsets here are some of the most spectacular on the planet and it did not disappoint.

Kuta beach is much cleaner than it used to be. We enjoyed a bintang under the trees while our son hired a boogie board. The surf was really good and he got value for his half hour board hire (50,000RP). He stayed between the flags and we had the reassurance of life guards and also the lovely guys who hired the board. At one stage I lost sight of my son and they were quick to reassure me and point him out. Sadly it was difficult to enjoy the lovely setting due to the "braiding/massage/sarong" ladies. I have been to Bali many times but found this trip that they were more intrusive than ever!

Stunning Sunsets, great beach scenes, surfers, canoes, kites - Kuta beach has it all.

Aside from the above there are many street stalls selling souvenirs (make sure you can take wooden objects back home), hair braiding/accessories, T/shirts and everything else you expect here, fortunately the Hawkers aren't overly persistent unlike other places we've been here.

Surfboards and lessons are available for a modest fee chairs and umbrellas are also on offer.

There are plenty of restaurants & bars along the waterfront with ring side seating for the sunsets, drinks are moderately priced - so are the meals.

Go and have a great evening!

Kuta is centre of an extensive tourist-oriented urban area that merges into the neighboring towns. Legian, to the north, is the commercial hub of Kuta and the site of many restaurants and entertainment spots. Most of the area's big beachfront hotels are in the southern section of Tuban.

We went on to the beach in the entrance outside Beachwalk Mall. We weren't even on the sand when we had men came up to us and asking us to come and buy things (hats etc), we said "no" but it was non-stop, with people from all directions coming up to us - calling us "darling" and making kissing sounds and constant "no's" from us. The beach was busy, and you are able to swim and rent sun chairs, but not much room as there are so many stalls etc on beach to just sit there and relax - unless you want to sit your towel down right next to the water. I would recommend a quieter beach if you are wanting to relax and unwind.

Waves are great if you want to surf or practice bodyboard. At 4:45 pm you'll attend an event wher baby turtles are released into the sea! That's very cute. Around 6pm you'll sit in a long chair watching the red sunset with a cold beer in your hand.

1. I went there in August 2015, the beach is clean, the water is cool, the sun is not too harsh, the sky is clear, the sand is soft, the air is clean (there's no salty air feel).

2. Perfect for the whole family. You can learn surfing, you can do shopping and eating at nearby beach mall (Discovery Mall and Beachwalk Mall), you can play beach ball, build sand castles, having traditional Balinese massage or just having a nap under the tree all day long.

This is a great place to spend a lazy afternoon, grab a corn on the cob from a street vendor at about 5pm, hit the beach and grab a icy cold bintang from a beach seller - this will get you a chair and sit back and watch the sun go down.
Our kids played soccer on the beach with the locals while we relaxed, this is most definetly one of the best ways to finish of a day of shopping and ammusements.

The beach is lovely, there's spots all up the beach with people offering surf boards, lessons and drinks. My other half managed to hire a surf board for a few hours for 50 Rupiah. Which was great, we often sat with them to have drinks from their bars which was a lot cheaper and nicer than in the street bars.
Only niggle is that there are a lot of people walking up and down the beach selling things which can be quite annoying and they are very persistent. Make sure you say no firmly and clear because if you sound doubtful they will be more forceful and if you say maybe later you can bet that they are watching you because they do come back. Again and again. But its all part of the experience and you can get some good bargains from them.

This beach is not virgin anymore. A bit dirty, but still popular because its strategic location.

PS: Ask for the price first before you decide to eat, drink, do massage, etc. Sometimes the sellers here put a very high price. I was fooled by drinking a Rp50.000 old coconut

I don't know why this place is so popular, yeah it does offer a very wide white sand beach, and if you love surfing, this place is one of the place that offers great experience. But for me, it's just to crowded, and too much local seller prowling around to offer you tattoos or massage, and problem is they just never give up and keep on coming, it's not like they are harsh or anything, they are very very polite, it's just that it could distract you from the privacy you want. But foreigners seems to enjoy their service very much, maybe I'm just the peace seeker type. Anyway, the surrounding of the beach is so alive, specially at night, many shoppings and foods and resorts and hotel. You love nightlife and alive places, go here!

The beach is very clean, despite usual natural leftovers. It is especially crowded in the evening. When going there around noon, be prepared for lots of people trying to sell you things you do not need. If you go a bit to the south there are also some very quiet areas. You can surf and swim there. Snorkeling is not recommended around the main area, as it is very sandy. Red flags are often up, prohibiting you from swimming.

What a beautiful friendly place to sit and watch the sunset. My friends and I went down to Sams Bar on the beach each afternoon and were greeted like long lost friends every day. The beach sellers offered us good prices for all their wares and left us alone when asked to.

We loved heading down to the beach and walking from south kuta to legian along the beach was much quicker and more pleasant than the street. Lovely blue water and great sunsets that are best about 30mins before sun goes down.
Check when high tide is and swim only between the flags as the current can be quite strong in some areas. Great beach to have a cold beer or some surfing lessons.

A must do in the afternoon. Sit and relax as you chat with friends and watch the planes roll in and out and wait for some gorgeous sunsets. My favorite beach bar is Suyit and Rudy's bar which is almost directly apposite Headquarters just past the big turtle. Well worth spending an hour or two there in the afternoon

No deck chairs to hire, just a plastic seat at one of the plethora of drink outlets. Those outlets are simply umbrellas with a few chairs, Eskies with drinks. Buy a drink and you can sit there for an hour or two.
If you want to sit on the sand, buy a sarong for $1 and use that or a mat. Expect to be bombarded with all sorts of things.
The beach seemed a bit she'll and the heat makes it undesirable to stay out for too long so be prepared to take refuge at a drink stand.
We would have liked to have gone more often and walked along the sand but his is best done early to mid evening when heat has abated.

Kura beach is the place to be if you want to see the sunset. They offer hair braiding on the beach, manicure, pedicure, massages etc might even get you a bargain or two. Or you can get in some surfing lessons. Or sit under an umbrella and have a bing tang

Great place to learn the basics of surfing but can get busy out there. Local instructors help with getting you stood up, then spend the rest of your trip practising/dreaming of riding the great barreling waves (like Uluwatu).

Love love love Kuta beach especially spending my days relaxing at Andys Happy Bar with a nice cold bintang or raddler. Everyone is so friendly and HAPPY :-). Its great for a swim or a surf with plenty of boards nearby to hire. The warungs nearby serve beautiful local food. If theres one thing you do at kuta beach the sunset is a must it is absolutely beautiful!!!! If you are there the right time a baby sea turtle release is also great thing to be part of. All in all beautiful :-)

Very crowdy beach with lots of tourist and locals. Hawkers are trying to sell various product. This beach is larger than other beaches in Bali. You can also see the plane landing view from the beach which is very amazing. A complete surfers place as it has very high waves. Just watch people surfing and enjoy the view.

Isn't it amazing, That so many people have completely different experience at the same place. I have never felt unsafe in Bali. I recently traveled with my best friend whom had never been to Bali and she had read into the whole Bali is dangerous hype. How wrong was she. From the moment she had her first bingtag she was in love with the place. We made friends with Ketut who works at Bobs bar on Kuta beach, yes the sellers annoy you, yes their persistent, yes they do your head in, but if you are polite and respond with 'tidak terima kashi' (no thank you) they do leave you alone. And remember, this is their job. This is how they make their tiny commission by doing the hard slog 8-10 hrs a day. There is no reason to be rude or ignore. Into the 2nd day the sellers would find me and my friend at Bobs bar and they would just sit and talk. By the end of the week we where like celebrities and most of Kuta beach knew our names and left us alone. Kuta is a great beach and has come a very long way in the past 10 years that I have been going and I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Bali.

Kuta beach, is a little over-rated, very crowded and seems to have it's fair show of locals constantly harassing tourists, in order to sell their wares and/or services.
Sadly, this would otherwise be a nice beach, not a great beach, if it were not for closeness of central Kuta. Also not a safe place at night!
Better off staying at your hotel or travelling up to Legian and Seminyak, so you are not harassed, "as much"!

My expectations of the beach were low from what friends had said but I found it quite pleasant, it was surprisingly clean, I didn't feel overly bothered by the locals and the boogie boarding was amazing, so much fun! We paid $5 for daily rental of the boards which may have been too much by local standards but worth it in our minds.

We came here after 2 days surfing at Old man's beach and I totally prefered this one because of the sand without the reef which makes surfing for beginners way safer and Also I found it easier to catch waves here. Overall Bali is great for surfing but if you are not surfer i am sure there are better places to go.

I always thought that when you say Bali, it's paradise beach. It isn't. Sand is fine, but not white. The good thing though is that it is a really long stretch. Not sure how many kilometers. Also perfect for surfing. Only problem is that every few meters that you walk, surf instructors will keep on asking whether you want to take a lesson

When you start to settle down your stuff at the beach, one by one coming to you and sell stuff. All at a time. My friend and I got surrounded by 4 vendors. Seriously, I'm here for the beach. If I need something, I'll ask for sure. Not disturbing my sweet time enjoying the beach..

The sunset beach is not really a great place to go. Its dirty with litter all over the beach and its crowded with hawkers trying to sell just about everything.

Its a spectacular beach for most of the year. Sun, surf, cold beers served. Eating at the beach bars while watching the sunset is a must.
However in the rainy season, Jan to March the beach looks like a landfill, with rubbish washing down every stream and river after every rainfall. This trash is NOT from tourism.
This trash is locals dumping their garbage in the waterways all over Indonesia.

Lots of locals selling clothes and other goods are positioned along the beach. Also, lots of locals selling cold drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. It seems one has to book a beach lounge, and then find somewhere to put it. Never seen a beach so packed. The sand is a beige colour and quite gritty so definitely need a chair or towel to sit on. Swamped with people of all ages vying for some shade in the hot sun. On the flip-side, the sunsets are amazing.

Grab a beer to enjoy the sunset or grab a friend to kick some footie but by all means you will have a lot of fun at Bali's main beach. It's not the pretties but it's worth a trip because it's two steps away from all other kinds of fun you may wish to have at a beach/city/village/park/place.

Sunset in Kuta is the best over the whole in Bali. The beach also very good to surf. The only bad thing in this beach is to many people come here. Sometimes even look too crowded.

Comparing to seminyak and Kuta, Legian is definitely less busy and is a chill place for those who want a relaxing environment. From time to time there are people approaching you for beer, fruits, magazines, sunglasses etc. But they will not lingering so it is ok.

It is a perfect place for surfing, the waves are about 1 metre high and long shore line. Not crowded at all.

This beach has different tempo when you visit in different time of the day. Morning, afternoon and during the sun set. One probably want to grab a drink and watch the sunset or walk along the shore line and you will find your peace of mind there.

The beach has been cleaned up a great deal since i was last here, which was nice not to have rubbish wrapping around me all the time. The water is beautiful and warm. The people are friendly. However it does get abit annoying with the continous hawkers trying to sell you something every few minutes when you are just trying to relax. Worth a look ans a swim however.

If you are not a beach person, i will recommend you just go there to see the sunset view. It's really beautiful when you see the sun reflecting on the seas, the waves clashing into the shores. Just need to ignore the crowd and noise.

But it's pretty dark at night as it's not fully lighted up, we brought a torch light with us when we walk back using the short cut towards our hotel. I'm not saying that it's not safe, but better to take precautions since there are bars and restaurants long that beach.

Nice beach. Good surfspot.
For people that just want to stroll, be aware anyway. I was in the ocean, not even until my knees when suddenly a very big wave came ……. and swept me of my feet (wave went over my head) so you might be aware of this, certainly if you are walking there with small children. (this was in December when the ocean is quite rough).

Being from the Gold Coast, Kuta Beach is equal to some. Visit in the afternoon, sit under the umbrellas, have a couple of coldies and watch the world go by. The only negative is tourists should be a little more respectful when it comes to taking their rubbish with them. Shame on you tourists.

Easy to get surf lessons. Walk on the beach lots of people will approach you, pick a group, get lessons. The lessons build so the teach a different skill on different days and let you practice. Its a lot of fun. Be warned laying on Kuta beach you will be bothered by people selling things. I found being friendly and firm and saying no was the quickest way. If they still won't leave lay down and pretend to sleep.

Before i went to Bali i heard people talking how good Bali is and also some negative review about it. i MUST say it is worth going once in a lifetime but not twice simply it is too costly , time wasting and publicly not safe ....!!! If only referring Kuta beach...this one is actually linked altogether with Legian beach & Seminyak beach as well ie. a combination !!! the place is crowded with local & tourists swimming / surfing and also a " discovery shopping mall " & " beachwalk shopping mall " nearby of it ....lunch/dinner,watch movies in cinema, buying souvenirs etc. The place has very good sightseeing particular at nighttime and lots of water activities. The hotel and also the building over Bali is full of hindu cultures to say the least...and i took lot of the photos and it is really beautiful i must say.

Ok so far so good but i only give 3 star rating ?! Why ? there are few reasons for this.

(1) public transport over there is FREAKING expensive & full of cheats taking advantage on tourists who come here for the FIRST time. if u plan to go around Bali ...prepare to spend a lot of taxi fares !!! wherever u go ....it is FREAKING far !!! using meter for taxi fares ? the drivers are smart enough to cons you mark my words !!! rent a motorbike to solve problems ? to a certain extent if u are wondering around just kuta & legian area it is fine BUT not the whole Bali...it is impossible even with GPS !!! shuttles bus ? they do have...but u rarely see it and it is NOT cheap either. rent a car ? not cheap either....If u have lots of money to spent i think it will be fine to just hired a driver , if u have your own budget then 2 options for u ...either walk on foot / motorbike !!!

(2) food is very expensive around kuta beach area and some of it is overpriced and not delicious. One u might wonder some of the local " warung makan " is better than those which are highly recommended.Do NOT expect hospitality in Bali restaurant , they are absolutely disappointed and rude to a certain extent ...!!! an example...i went to one of the restaurant and i ordered " fried rice " so does some other tourists, they showed sigh of despise !!! Tips ? i don't give tips personally but i heard some tourist went there and did give tips. Before i back to Malaysia i have a teatime in a restaurant and they dint giving back my changes that is around 7000 rupiah....i know it is very little value of it BUT still they owed a duty to give back and if....i think of giving tips i will if i want to but surely not SELF DEEMED !!! and if u were to go their local " warung makan " for some cheap & delicious food , the hygiene and cleanliness over there is TERRIBLE no fans let alone air-conditioner and the ventilation & space is very stenosis to the least !!!

(3) some like the custom rule " corruption " , local money changers does take into accounts. Before u comes to Bali have all your money convert to rupiah OR go to their local ATM machine even though the charging rate will be slightly expensive BUT it is safer and avoiding " local traps ". Apart from that, if u walking down the street to anywhere virtually every localist u meet over there , they will keep bugging u with the same question over and over " transport ? massage ? any women ? " and the water over there ....prepare yourself with few big bottles of mineral water as their water over there is dirty and smelly.

what more can one ask for, beer every 5 metres, nice sand, clean water. I suppose the only downer are the traders who want to sell you everything however they are easily fixed. Always get my manicure, pedicure, ears, eyebrows etc etc done when having a Bintang.

What do I love the most of Kuta Beach? It simply because this beach contains every kind of people from all over the world! You can find some people from middle east covering their faces in wearing black covers only meters away with some girls from Australia wearing only bikinis! Or some people from Java wearing hijab and looks so religious enjoying meatball right next to local Balinese drinking Beers while eating Babi Guling (Suckling Pig)!

All of those people shares the common happiness and for a while, we can forget about how this world torn apart because of religion! Kuta Beach is a symbol of peace and freedom!

Kuta beach already be a big tourist spot in Bali. Way way too crowded but still attractive. I love to walk along this beach and play with waves.

I had been a regular pool hanger as it was so easy to just jump into the pool but this year we decided to give the beach a try, was actually quite good, not really bothered by hawkers had a few massages, ate plenty of magnum classics, swam in the ocean, and deck chairs lovely and comfortable.

I'm rating this as average as I think if you were here for a night and just want to party then it'd be good enough, more orientated to groups of people. It's not a true representation of Bali at all. Some bars had live music on at night so you can get a decent night out with free entertainment but you will pay more for drinks here than in most other places.
Lots of families and groups of friends here but the place is expensive, the local people are rude here - hassled, followed, stalked by the taxi drivers & shop owners.

Traffic is busy (if you get a taxi to Kuta, get them to drop you off at the top of one of the side streets and walk down to the main road where you can easily access places / the beach, otherwise you will pay a significant amount more in meter taxis.) If you're trying to get a taxi out of kuta at night, also consider a lot of the roads are one way so you may be best walking a little as traffic gets gridlocked. It was 78,000 in a meter taxi (Bluebird) back to Jimbaran. The non metered fake bluebird taxi charged 100,000 to get there.

The beach is a nice stretch and lots of surfers but actually the waves were not that big and Dreamland beach was much better for surfing. I think Kuta beach is better for generally relaxing, some swimming, body boarding, surfing, especially if you want to learn to surf as the waves are quite gentle but if you go further out, you can get some good ones.

There are numerous beach sellers, some have umbrellas & plastic chairs to sit on - the drinks are not too badly priced here - cheaper than the bars and it's a great place to sit, chat to locals / tourists alike and watch the sunset, which can be stunning here. You can also see the planes landing at the airport - very busy! There are toilet blocks every so often which charge around 3000 rupiah but the one I used wase clean and had showers, so actually not that bad. Sunbeds are also available for hire. You may get the odd person pestering you to buy a bracelet or massage but it wasn't too invasive.

It's easy enough to get around on foot and there are lots of places to eat, but a lot are very touristy and the food is not good & not a good price either. If you just go for the day like I did, find one of the quieter warungs to eat in for a better price & quality.

I just went to see what the fuss was about, but it wasn't worth the cost of a taxi and had it not been for meeting some nice people at the beach, I would've left a lot sooner!

Walking down kuta beach is awesome. The beach is a lot cleaner than it used to be. Full of people taking surf lessons or sunbathing. You don't get hassled as much as you used to here in Bali now. If you do want to bug a pair of sunnies expect to pay around $5 Australian $ for Polaroids . But you must ask for them as the keep them seperate . Great to have a stroll

One of the famous landmark in Bali. I didn't try to swim coz I had the Ida hotel's comfortable pool. I tried a night walk. Safe with neon light and much people hanging around. But avoid dark corner.

My wife and I really enjoy a early morning walk along along the beach from Tuban to Seminyak, which takes you straight through iconic Kuta beach. If you can drag yourself out of bed before all the sellers get down to the beach, say around 6am, then you will really enjoy what Kuta has to offer. Glassy ocean views, waves with the occasional surf riding them and other like minded individuals who enjoy a quite time down the beach. The first time I went to Kuta was in 1981 and the only time it reminds you of those days is at 6 in the morning. Rise early and enjoy.

We spent some time here enjoying the surf. My husband found some guys with some boards and negotiated on the spot for surf board usage, no lessons. They were really great and lent my teenager a rash guard shirt to protect himself. To use the shower or bathroom at Kuta, you have to pay a man standing outside the door. He didn't give any TP or other items, just took the money. Down some of the side streets off Kuta Beach are shopping alleys filled with stuff, so it is very central. Tons of young people, lots of cars honking and people running about. The day we were there, they released a hundred baby turtles into the sea - very cool! No peace and quiet at Kuta, but lots of music, people milling about, coming to watch the gorgeous sunset, and grab some food at the nearby food shacks or restaurants.

Iconic Kuta beach is must to see, althought spendin 1 day or sunset there is enought. The beach by itself is always crowded, full of people and vendors which relectes to its no so good cleanless.
On the other hand can be good for meeting new people and sunset from hereis really beautiful.

Kuta beach is very impressive. Particularly during early hours and at dawn.
Long clean sand coast line with Indian ocean in front.
During the hide tide, looking at huge tides is unforgettable experience. Lot of sports activities including surfing for those who dare to try.
Across the roads, plenty of hotels/restaurants for a coffee break. Ideal place to stay for sea lovers.

The beach was not as good as other beaches I've been to but apparently the waves were really good for surfing because of wave intervals. The nice thing about the beach was the lounging and watching people bustle about around you. ALTHOUGH the vendors are quite annoying trying to sell you stuff every five minutes or so.

The beach is very nice, given its 12 hours use, all day every day. The walk from the bottom of Poppies 1 along to the edge of the airport fence was something my wife and I done every morning and it was lovely. Quiet, clean, and a great way to keep fit and clear the Bintang induced head. There is a well maintained footpath running the length of the beach, almost va hidden Kuta secret.

I enjoy Kuta Beach because it's a beach. It's reasonably clean, the people selling things weren't too agressive when I was there, and the sun was warm. As far as totally amazing, picture perfect white sand beaches, this isn't it. Yes, the water isn't perfectly clear, but a lot of that is due to the somewhat heavy surf. The wave was heavy and perfect the day I was there. I simply body surfed, but a lot of people were learning to surf and seemed to be having some success.

Kuta Beach is filled with people trying to get money from you. At night guys stand around offering everything from viagra to mushrooms to ladies, and during the day, the shop owners pretend to be your friend while luring you into their shops. It's annoying. The traffic is terrible, the internet speed downright sucks, and the bars are only so-so. If you want to go to Bali, stay at Sanur Beach or Denpasar and concentrate on other activities such as diving, sightseeing, and seeing the local culture. My recommendation: stay as far from Kuta Beach as possible!

The beach is average. the cleanliness needs to be worked on. I was staying in hard rock so I didnt have much choice. Too much annoying locals trying to sell their merchandise. the water is not very clear, but the waves were pretty chill.

If you are staying in Kuta or just passing through, this is a place you must see. I wouldn't really recommend it as a place to travel miles and miles to experience though. To access the beach, just ride your motorbike as far West in Kuta as you can go and you'll eventually get there. It was a little difficult to find parking amid the sea of motorbikes, but not impossible. You have to pay 2000 IDR when you leave. That's the standard fee I think, so don't let them rip you off for more.

The beach is gigantic, the waves are great, and the sunset is beautiful. But beware, Kuta beach is crowded - in fact, one of, if not, the the most crowded beach I've ever seen. One gigantic party with the odd solo person or couple walking in between the groups snapping selfies. Although having said that, it was not as dirty as I imagined. Sure there was a piece of trash here and there, but it wasn't the toxic mess that some people had made it out to be. For that amount of people, it could be a lot worse. Just don't expect to go searching for shells in the black sand, they've been scavenged decades ago.

I HATE Kuta beach. The water is disgusting - it looks brown. Sitting in the beach is so unenjoyable as you're CONSTANTLY harassed with "Hello you buy sumting?", "Hello you want massage", "you surf? Surf surf? Yes please!" and saying no isn't enough. They ask you "why not?" or sit down beside you trying to guilt you into buying something. I get people are trying to earn a living but they need a lesson in how not to harass people.

The only thing it is good for is surfing. If you can find a space in the water that is!

I have been to lot beaches in India, Dubai, US, Thailand etc but I must mention that beaches in Bali are class apart. Water is so clean even in the urban beach of kuta which is I must say is in the heart of the city but still so clean water.

The atmosphere was like a big party in the whole area of kuta, with Hard Rock cafe just outside beach mind blowing stuff.

The beach is lovely and Sandy, slight slope towards the waters edge at high tide. No sunbeds on the beach although you can sit at Jimmy's bar outside the Turtle Sanctuary on the beach directly behind the safe swimming flags.
Hire a surfboard for a while, or one of Jimmy's staff will give you a one to one lesson on how to catch the waves.
Visit the Turtle Sanctuary where you can offer to release one of the newly hatched turtles back into the sea at sunset, small donations welcomed.

Kuta is still the best public and crowded beach in SE Asia in my opinion compared to Patong and Chenang which also famous in Thailand and Malaysia. I always enjoy the sunset there and you can walk miles along the beach and sit free with your own beach towel ormat wherever you want. Observing the crowds and their activities around you will be a good way to enjoy a day while waiting gor the sun to go down.

Great for beginner surfers, couples wanting to stroll the sands and families playing catch this beach offers it all. From strolling vendors trying to sell everything from sarongs, henna tattoos and getting your toenails painted to numerous people inviting you to sit under their umbrellas for a beer can eventually become a bit tiring when all one wants to do is enjoy watching the waves.

Advice, find a chair or two from one of the many people offering drinks (all priced the same about $2 usd small Bitang) or surfboard rentals from which after a few polite nods of no interest in sarongs or nails getting done they’ll leave you alone. Perhaps as when we were they’ll pass the time with you in conversation as opposed to selling you something, learning about the locals, lifestyles and more. The people here really know that tourism is key to their livelihood, from which friendliness is not overlooked.

Don't ever go here! Worst place I've ever been! So unsafe! We were walking down the road by the best western hotel and a moped drove past us and mugged my friend! He stole everything! So scary! And when we went to the police station they didn't care! It seems like it happens all the time as there was 3 other girls who had the same thing happen to them!

I'm not the type of bloke to take my own surf board to Bali... I'm not the type of bloke that is keen on surfing sharp reef's.... AND I definitely ain't the type of surfer that is able to ride huge waves without changing the colour of my undies...(brown).
SO Kuta beach Bali, is the best spot for the average person to have a go and have a few laughs out in the drink... Why fly a board around the world when your just a casual hack?? Rent a board from a local help his family, if your not into foamies don't panic there is always a glass board in amongst the pile, and if the nearest local hasn't got one the next bloke will. Kuta beach was an easy walk from where we were staying and the drinking establishments between the beach and the hotel were always cheap and always supplied cold beer, (Bintang) I enjoyed it so much I went again an again... Do it , there are locals willing too coach you if you haven't any surf skills.. I was watching plenty of Chinese, Europeans and the occasional American enjoy the same waves.. sometimes small sometimes big and anything inbetween.. I loved it.

At the back of the Grand Inna Kuta Hotel is the Bali Sea Turtle Society ... a massive hatchery within a turtle!! At 4.30pm every day you have the opportunity to release a turtle in to the ocean. This was a very cool experience. You can see the turtles emerge from the sand in the hatchery before they are placed into tubs to be released by the public. As a large group we all released our turtle from behind a rope-line and watched them swim and be washed off by the waves just before sunset. Unfortunately only 1 in a 1000 will make it, but these guys are working hard to ensure that they are assisted ... they really try and educate everyone a little too which is great ..

Can't wait to go back.

Kuta beach has white sand and good surf, however it is a busy beach with lots of people trying to sell things constantly to the point that it is annoying. But however there are areas that there are men selling drinks from eskies and chairs that you can sit and enjoy a rest with a view - the drinks are very cheap and very cold which is great. There are market stalls very near to get your shopping done.

Kuta can be a little overwhelming but if you can handle crowds, love the party life and noise, do spend more time here. Its extremely crowded and your car can get stuck there for a long time in the traffic. The views of the beach weren't any great
However it has some of the cheapest hotels and a huge shopping strip which can take a good part of your day. Lots of restaurants and options too, but be prepared for long waiting queues to get a table in the good ones

The water had medium turbidity, was a bit colder than other beaches, and had nice, medium to high wave energy. The water being more murky is a result of the cooler water providing a better habitat for plankton, and the waves stirring up sand. Overall the water was nice to swim in, and the sand was soft. The beach was crowded but not overwhelmingly so. The best part of our visit however, was the turtles. The Bali Sea Turtle Society is located on the beach, an organization dedicated to protecting the island's sea turtles. We got to carry the baby turtles out to the sand, release them, and watch them swim away. The staff were very friendly. We also got to witness baby turtles hatching and digging up through the sand in their enclosure, and learned about what the organization does. Overall it is a nice beach, and 100% worth visiting if for the turtles alone.

We went after the sunset but surprisingly the beach had nothing to offer during the night. It was completely dark. Nothing to do or eat or stroll post sunset. Well ofcourse you can still enjoy a hand in hand romantic stroll with the sounds of wave roaring in back ground but still I felt it was way too dark to stay during that hour. I was told its the best beach in Bali but didn't get a chance to visit during day time!

It may not be the most beautiful beach but it provides you with very pleasing view and many good spots for surf beginners.

It's a beach, it's quite wide, surfers try to find perfect wave (or survive), in between there are casual swimmers. Sand is good, although not perfect, there are touts, plenty of them actually, selling mostly some useless junk. There are sports activities throughout the day, you can get average massage here, but have to bargain hard to bring price to reasonable level, there are umbrellas without them most of fair skinned people like me would not survive.

Kuta beach is a great place to spend a few hours, the locals keep the beach clean, sweeping and burying weed that is washed in over night. The waves are often enough for a bit of surfing and if you get out early in the morning it is not so busy on the better waves. It is possible to hire motor scooters with a bracket on them to take your surf board, this will allow you to venture a bit further to find a good wave.

Beaches near hotels have people selling all sorts of items, it is not like it used to be years ago, but, they are still there. there is always the offer to have a massage while you are laying on the beach, have a "manicure", or flat your hair (they cant say "p").

Remember that the sun is nasty in Bali and you can get sun burnt really quickly, sun burn cream and shade. also some water to drink, buy a couple of big bottles on the way to the beach, you will be happy to drink them a bit warm and you wont have to go through a bargaining process to simply get a drink.

Not my favourite beach I have been to, I felt like I was constantly being harassed to buy something or to pay for a service. They sand is a grubby brown colour with cigaret buds and rubbish laying around

Kuta is a very busy area where throngs of people are looking for a party place. Amazing night life out there and can go around easily if one hires a scooty/bike which comes at a fair price. Lots of water sports options and don't forget to goto The Hidden Beach which we missed due to some reasons.

Kuta beach is busy, you'll get harangued by persistent vendors offering everything from massages and henna tattoos to bow and arrow sets! (I kid you not) - but once you realise that this is common for any very well populated tourist beach and get over it... you find something beautiful there....

Grab a deck chair for 50,000 the pair for an hour 100,000 the pair for 3 hours (they will ask for more but will accept this if you say it confidently and walk off to find another vendor as the place is LINED with vendors with pop-up bars and chairs with umbrellas so you can chill and watch the most amazing waves and tens of experienced and amateur surfers...

when I say the waves are amazing i'm not exaggerating. They are a sight to behold - never seen waves like them! No matter how active you want to be there is plenty of choice in this busy tourism mecca that is Kuta - if you want a quieter beach Nusa Dua (45mins+) or Seminyak (15 mins) may help or you can go to the other end of Kuta beach where it was remarkably quieter if you are facing the ocean its basically to your FAR right.

Everything is more expensive on the beach (drinks are 2-4x their cost from a shop - but who cares...? still only a couple dollars!

If you are offered anything 'illegal' JUST SAY NO! not worth it - be a good tourist behave yourself and have a stoking time in this amazing place. One of my favourite beaches in Asia.

(beach is clean)

I've been to the Kuta / Legian / Seminyak region several times but noticing prices just keep creeping up and up.
A scooter lift from Kuta to the airport only a couple years ago would have been 35k IDR without much bartering, this week I couldn't get a lift for less than 100k IDR and that was down from 200k IDR! I'm sure if I bartered for 10-15 min I could have gotten a better prices, but it was cheaper and easier to just catch a Blue Jay taksi with a meter (70k IDR)

I've also noticed friendly locals are slowly being replaced with little thugs, dealing drugs, women and always looking for a hustle.
It's sad, but I see Bali biting the hand that feeds it.
Bali needs tourism, tourism doesn't need Bali - sorry guys

If tropical, picture-perfect tropical beach is what you're after, skip Kuta and southern Bali. Go to Gili Islands instead. The beach at Kuta Beach water is muddy - you can't see the bottom due to the sand stirred up by the waves. Good for surfing, or body boarding - in fact, most of the beach is designated surfing area. There are flags indicating where it's safe to swim, though it's over-run by wanna-be surfers.

The sand is brown-gray. The peddlers are pushy trying to sell all kinds of trinkets. Ignore them, be stern, or they stick around.

Also, make sure to get all your shots before traveling to Indonesia. You never know what kinds of sewage is floating in the water. Don't come here during low-season - do a search on all the trash on the beach and you'll know why.

Overall, a disappointment which turned into an enjoyable fun experience as the two of us (28yo/35yo) rented some body boards and went body boarding.

Seen it. Shopping etc is a hassle, Best thing to do is go down during sunset. this is when this place gets interesting. lots of people, a few shows, fireworks, Sunset to watch atmosphere is much better.

One thing I wish was that people cleaned up after themselves more there. IF you go down to main bali beaches during early morning you will see all the bulldozers they use to try and make the beach at least look clean, I am ashamed of all the rubbish people leave on the beaches.

There are little waves so you can try to learn surfing, which is available any where on the beach.

This is nice wide beach fronting a buzzing area of Bali. The waves make it hard to swim, but surfers like it. You can rent beach amenities here from local vendors at the numerous entrances from the street to the beach. Make sure your beachfront hotel has a pool if you want to be able to swim with ease. Both locals and tourists enjoy visiting this beach.

Kuta Beach has it's good and bad points. I found it to be very clean, as they remove the rubbish daily. We stayed at the Grand Inna so straight out the back is the turtle conservation place where they hatch turtles and release them in the afternoons. It doesnt cost anything to release a baby turtle and it is a very rewarding thing to do. Right near the turtles is the Simpson's Bar run by Robby and Simpson, very lovely young guys. You will get sellers trying to sell you stuff or give you a massage, but if you aren't interested you just say "no thank you". Sometimes they are persistent, but just keep saying "no thank you" and they will go away. Or you might make some nice new Balinese friends, just depends on yourself and how you want to be with them. The sunsets are spectacular if there is no clouds. The corn on the cob is wonderful. Give Kuta Beach a go, see what you reckon.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,441,50>===============

I was here in Kuta the year the bomb went off. In fact I missed it by 3 days. It was then slightly built up with the Hard Rock Cafe as the centre point. 15 years later the the beach is covered in plastic bottles, bottle tops and crisp packets. What a shame. The whole area of Kuta is now alive with shops you get in London, Paris and any big city. It's expensive, load and lost all the surf dude buzz. Just full of young men walking up and down with beer bottles and being loud. Not my cup of tea.

One of the most popular places in Bali, Kuta offers one of the best waves in the island, specially for beginners with lots of instructors all around. The beach isn't the cleanest neither the most colorful but its a common place for people gatherings, specially during sunset. Lots of party nights start here so if you want to follow the young vibe, this is your place to start.

Beautiful beach to see the sunset.
But too crowded and dirty.
I went 2 times but can't see the sunset properly because of the clouds.
But still worth to visit.
If you want to spend more quality and romantic time with your couple, i suggest Jimbaran beach.
The food is a bit pricey but has beautiful sunset too and more clean.

I was very disappointed with the beach area at Kuta/Legian. We walked along the beach early one morning and there were workers in the process of cleaning it, but there was still a lot of rubbish in the water, plastics ( of all sorts) a disposable nappy, broken glass etc and then ....a man openly urinating in the water. Such a pity as the surf lessons looked like they would be fun. I also did wonder if you went swimming what you could do with your belongings to keep the them safe and there didn't appear to be anywhere to change.

If you are looking to party during your visit to Bali, Kuta is the place for you. If you are looking for the true Balinese experience; avoide Kuta at all cost. Very commercialized, busy and noisy place - not the paridise you associate with Bali and hardly a representation of the culture at all. The beach is beautiful and great place to surf, but you could have a similar experience at Daytona Beach, FLA.

Kuta Beach is a nice beach if you are beginner in surfing. You can not swim there like in Nusa Dua beach as there are people with surfboards around you and the waves are hitting you. They are not that big, just enough for starting to surf. We took 2 surfing classes with the best surffing school - Odyssey Surf School in Kuta and we amazed.
You can see some pictures attached. So i suggest Nusa Dua beach for swimming and enjoying and Kuta Beach for surfing. You can also have a drink in Kuta beach for a 1 US or 2 US but you will be siting on a plastic chair with no table, and local people are offering many things: fruits, sarongs, messages, hair braiding etc.

Bali is rich in culture and has some of the best sun sets I've seen. I had a great time shopping in the market place and in their shopping centers.

Rubbish beach. Have no loyalty to this beach any more it has become such a sesspit, it used to be a normal quiet day place but is now beyond redemption and every time we come to Baluwe drive through Kuta to get elsewhere. Itsy still very popular with Okkas from Australia who descend in droves ,they have taken over Kuta then Legion and Seminyak , its the equivalent of the Spanish resorts with Brits.Busy and there are scenes of total rip offs and unhappy experiences.

Yes it's busy and madness most of the time, but if you just like to soak up an atmosphere, people watch and immerse yourself in a new culture, this is a great place to start.
I recommend Adis beach Bar on the beach, right across the road from the Shereton.
My 8 year old son was taught surfing by an amazing local called Hendra. Talk about having an affinity with youngsters. OLLIE entrusted him with his life out there, and got him hooked so looks like we will be buying a board.
Yes there are hawkers, but if you stay at the same bar for long enough, they soon give up.
It's the same as you walk up to Seminyak 30 to 40mins away, it just gets gradually quiet.
It's also cleaner than I expected, but the rubbish generally come from tourists which is ironic!!!

This beach is actually very beautiful with some big waves and a must visit for surfers, but there were a lot of locals trying to sell stuff from towels to nail art (?) you have to buy a drink to sit down on a plastic chair, at first me and my friends bought 2 water bottles so that we can sit down and enjoy the beach. Within 20 minutes the seller told us that we have to buy 4 drinks considering there were 4 of us sitting on his plastic chairs. Laying down on the sand on beach towel is a better option but there will always be locals offering you their massage service, nail art, tattoos, etc. They just won't quit!

I have visited Kuta Beach since 1975, in those many years it has changed over and over again but there is an attraction that keeps me coming back. In the past 5 years I have visited Bali on four occasions each for a four week holiday. Kuta Beach is my second favourite to Legian Beach. In Kuta you will find everything you need, shopping, Bars Restaurants and of course Hotels from the cheap homestays to Luxury International Hotels. For shopping there are both original brand name stores and the cheap copies for everything from watches to shoes it is all there. International restaurant chains are everywhere so what ever you crave it is available. After a long walk in the hot sun the beach is always a welcome sight with its wish Sandy beach a dip in the surf sure cools you down. There are hundreds of beach umbrellas and banana lounges to hire as well as bean bags so you can relax have a cold drink and watch the world go by.

The myth of Kuta beach is declining specially for surfer people . If want to take surf lessons you could find good teacher but very exspensive if you are a tourist without a former Bali experience . The beach is almost clean but pay attention to what seems little rivers in ealty are open sewers. The sea is not good and dangerous if you want just to take a bath better Sanur or Nusa Dua as well . During Christamas holidays easy to find tons of garbage coming from the opposit island of Java that beacuse different sea currents during that period. Sun beds suggestion price not more than 50.000 idr x day within umbrella

Great beach and stunning sunset drink place. The restaurants are now a bit to conveyor belt like - the game is to get as many in - and out - in a hurry. beware when they weight he fish you have picked - they may forget to remove a load of ice cubes stuffed inside the fish before the weighing, making it a very costly fish.

You'll get the best sunset photos over the ocean at Kuta.
You can sit on the sand, sit on regular garden furniture for free at the local beach bars with the cheapest prices, (all sealed bottles), or pay a lot more for sunbeds, umbrellas and cocktails.
It's a nice long beach, great to walk along for exercise, but most people swim in the hotel pools. Nice sand, but there is some ground down volcanic rock seen as black sand.
Learn to say "No Thanks!" to the many sellers and they leave you alone. They offer massages, nail polish, henna tattoos, hair braiding, T-shirts, trinkets, bracelets, gadgets and everything imaginable!
Before you speak, make sure if you are interested or not in the item for sale/haggling, because if you touch an article they will hassle you into buying at least one item.
It is all good fun, especially if you relax with friends and drinks watching a beautiful sunset, get what you want from the sellers, and realize that they go away when you say "No Thank You!"

id avoid this beach like the plague mostly because with all the garbage in the water youll probably get the plague or some such infection. the guys renting surfboards are boarder line mafioso. dont be fooled by the indonesian innocent smile, they will stab you in the back, again, not a metaphor.

Kuta is not the paradise island you might thought!!! The city is just crowded of tourist, you don't have the chance to see the real balinese culture. The beach is as normal as others in the world. Good for learning to surf. The sunset is just amazing!!! If you want to party and stuff Kuta is your place!!! It is really cheap, but people want to rip you off.

Kota beach is totally unrepresentative of the beautiful island of Bali however during your stay it is a must see day out. Thousands of predominantly European / Australian young people having a full on beach holiday in a relatively small piece of real estate. Streets are full of very annoying hawkers either selling cheap rubbish or offering tickets to night clubs / bars. Keep your hand on your wallet. You will be so happy to return to the peace and tranquility of Sanur beach by the end of the day. However if you are 20 something you will,have a great vacation on KUTA beach.......

Nice beach, but the hassle off the folks selling stuff becomes annoying.We visited the beach a couple of times, nice beach, clean, good views. The only part we found annoying was the people selling stuff, on one occasion myself & my 2 young daughters sat under one of the umbrellas whilst enjoying a nice cold water and watching the ocean and we were inundated with people selling bracelets, fruit, do you want hair braid, nails painted etc etc. On the 2nd occasion we left much earlier than we would have as they were so persistent. If you don't mind this then its a great beach for the kids, there's a patrolled section for them to swim safely.

This is not the typical white sand beach that a beach goer expects but it was very clean and not crowded (during the time the we went there). Many locals offer surfing lessons with surf board rental and they were nice and accomodating too. Waves were huge and perfect for surfing. Lucky when we went there, they were holding a surfing competition and that was my first to witness such. Also, chairs and umbrellas were out for rent if you want to relax and just hang out. It was really an awesome experience and i will definitely go back to Kuta beach.

Lovely beach , but no Watersport because of big waves,it a good field for learn how to surf. Kuta beach and I think all bali beaches is not very good for water sport and playing in the waves, but we enjoyed big waves too.

The beauty of Kuta beach is all the activity. It has a decent surf wave at times, there are a myriad of shops and sellers, and it has a very long tide that washes up interesting creatures etc for the kids to discover in the evenings. Some people get overly-bothered by sellers, but I've never seen this personally in all my visits - a polite "No" just like anywhere else in Bali and you're left alone. Kuta beach is a fun place to hang out on holiday.

Not the most exotic of beaches. Darker sand and quite crowded. Nice for exploring in the evenings, but for a day at the beach if you are in the area, go further north to Seminyak. Otherwise there are better beaches in Bali for the true tropical touch.

We traveled here in peak season however because of the eruption of the volcano and subsequent disruption to flights the locals told us that it was a lot quieter than usual, which was great. still very busy but not overwhelming so. The beach is very long and wide so you didn't feel like it was crowded even though there are thousands of people spread along it.

Kuta Beach is full of tourists. The Beach is behind hotels and restaurants in Kuta. I went through Discovery Shopping Mall. There is not entrance fee.

Kuta Beach is located at the island's narrow isthmus, very close to the airport. Once a quiet fishing village, it has been transformed into a busy area with hotels, restaurants and lots of shops. The waves here are huge and it is a perfect place to learn to surf.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,449,30>===============  
The main Kuta beach is opposite the many hotels and shops that line the streets. You enter through stone gates in a fence that separates the path and street from the beach. You can't expect a beautiful white sandy swimming beach. The beach itself seems to be formed from lava and pumice as it is very dark grey/blackish. The water is very tidal, with waves and often very rough. There are some great places along the beach where you can learn to surf and often you get some very good large waves there. Beware if you are not a strong swimmer. Many have drowned in these waters. That is one reason why the local hotels have pools. The beach is full of pop up bars and sun lounges under umbrellas. To use a sun lounge you are supposed to drink beverages or beer from the local stall holder and/or sometimes pay a fee. Small fees for thing like parking and admission should only be about rp2.000. When we went over for a look and sat on a sun lounge to watch the sunset we were attacked by Ladies offering Massages and pedicures. Even if you say No or Tidak. They carry on. I had one women attacking me to massage, one on either foot, and one on my hands..... Aaargh... They then demanded money for services and wanted rp100.000 each! A massage in a street spa costs between rp 50.000 & 80.000! Many other hawkers were harassing us to buy their wares. I actually felt violated when we left! So if you dare, be very very confident and say No! Last tip. They all ask where you are staying so they know how much to demand from you. Don't tell them that you are staying at any of the upmarket hotels (even if you are) or they will try to rip you off. Tell them you are staying at a home stay or something cheap.

Kuta beach is a long beach next to the Denpasar international airport with almost white sand, moderate waves (~1m) perfect for surfing beginners to practice and also for fun (but not for children and poor swimmers), beach walk with numerous shops (mostly clothing, food, art market and souvenirs) and luxurious hotels and just behind the beach walk there are small streets with numerous small restaurants. On the beach you can rent the chair or deckchair under the beach umbrella, take surfing lessons, buy some drinks and even occasionally find a woman selling self made soup. Everything costs money, bargaining is a must. If you are lucky and there are no clouds on the horizon, you can see a sunset from the beach. Best equipped, most commercial and most funny beach on Bali according to my experiences (been to Nusa Duva, Sanur, Jimbaran and Kuta). If you look for beach for children, choose Sanur, quiet beach with less people, less commerce and lower waves is Nusa Dua.

Good waves to learn to surf on with lots of surf schools on the beach and in Kuta! You can borrow a board off the beach for about 200k for a whole day if you want it in the morning or go down poppies 1 and find a surf shop about 5 minutes walk down and you can borrow one for only 80k for a whole day!

Kuta is most happening beach , it is very lively always full of tourist. It is quite a long beach merge with almost Seminayak beach. You can find so many eating outlets along the beach. So many massage facilities on the beach, one can have beer, coconut or fruits cocktails sold by vendors. You can have jute mat or plastic chairs on rent from locals.

Good for 2 days then get out of the rat race and go and explore the real bali and mix with the beautiful peolple.
Dont just do day trips go and stay in other areas. Up north over to the other side and do other island.
Especially love the vibe in Ubud.
Nusa Lombongan is only a 30 minute boat ride with Scoot. Or do all three island hops. Spend a few days at each Gilli Tranwangun, nusa lombongan and Bali.

It is a great place to hang out for a beer. Surfing is good usually at high tide but waves are small. Many small bars on the beach. Unfortunately at the first rain of year around December washes thousands of tons of rubbish from the the streets to beach. The clean up goes on for many weeks. Also seminyak has raw sewage flowing into ocean so can be a problem if you swim in the area.

Mile upon mile of sandy beach which provides a playground for walkers, beach games and surfing for which Kuta Beach is world renowned. The waves off Kuta Beach are ideal for learning to surf and late afternoon, depending on the tides, the surf can provide a challenge for even the most experienced surfers. For those just wanting a dip in the Ocean beware of the rip-tides which can prove fatal.

The Balinese have formed themselves into small teams responsible for keeping sections of the beach clean and in return they can hire out surf boards, provide surfing lessons, rent out sun beds and offer cool drinks (soft and alcoholic). Snacks are also available from the beach vendors.

Evening time is very popular with the Balinese families who head to the Beach to experience the magnificent sunset.

Balinese people even come from any province to have an idea of a business in Bali because Bali akomadasi best center and a lot of foreign tourists visiting, although not all swords can bekomunkasi well but I'm proud as traders tersbut trying to learn and fulfill what desired by the customere.

We walk from Seminyak and pass this area which is always busy with people either swimming, learning to surf or just lounging. There's the usual massage available and people selling or sorts of things but the hard sell isn't there so it's not that bad. There are however plenty of Australians and not always the best ambassadors if they've had a few too many Bintangs but overall it's just a slice of Bali and you have to go at least once.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,453,30>===============  
Kuta Beach is an icon in Bali for Australians and other visitors. It's still worth a look but it's busy, packed with tourists and hawkers and there's better swimming/surfing beaches north and south. It does lack a decent toilet so use a cafe one nearby before coming. The upside is there's lots of cheap eats if you're game. Still a lovely sunset and the deck of the Hard Rock Cafe gives a good view. It's interesting to at least walk it once south to north or vice versa, maybe from about 5pm to experience the sunset.

I try to remain entirely objective when writing these notes but this one is difficult.

Bali is without a doubt one of the worst places I have ever visited in my life. I cannot think of a single good thing about it in all honesty.

We arrived on the ferry from Gili T into a grimy run-down port then spent two hours in a smashed bus driving along roads lined with garbage and trash to a city which is like Blackpool. With none of Blackpool's sophistication or beauty.

In the process of getting there out driver took great delight in running over and killing three dogs in one go. This in a bus containing small children and a bunch of adult dog owners and lovers.

We could not wait to leave Bali and completely fail to understand why anyone would see this as somewhere worth visiting let alone considering it a South Sea paradise ...

If I could I would rate the whole place as a minus five tourist toilet.

What can I say more about Kuta Beach,it's already well known.people from all over the world who visit Bali,surely ever visit Kuta Beach. If you wanna enjoy other side of Kuta Beach,try "nasi kucing". It's a small amount of rice (that's why it called nasi kucing,it means rice for cat.in indonesia we used to give our pet like cat a small amount of rice), with fried fish or sambal added. The price is cheap about 5000 idr for one nasi kucing.this nasi kucing usually wrapp with banana leaf.

I think enough has been said and written about the most famous beach in Bali. This place is still beautiful, with the sunset, and with the surf.

Traffic is horrible, especially near sunset time. Either you come in advance, or park somewhere and walk to the beach. Best reached with motorcycle. And bring your kite here.

Be prepared to get harassed by locals selling their goods and services, if you're not interested just say no thank you wave them away. However, beer, massages, surfing lessons and many more are available every 10m.

Objectively, Kuta is a very nice beach with white sand and beautiful waves and sunsets, but everyone knows that and I don't want to go over that again. As a native I wanted to give out a few tips which I think will help greatly on your travel.

First and foremost there are waves of people as there are waves of water at Kuta, so protecting your belongings is the primary concern. Put an eye on them all the time and never leave them.

Secondly, as with all international place of interest, Kuta is home to many money-seekers who will do anything to earn your money. Avoid being near tattoo artists unless you want a tattoo. Avoid surfboard sellers if you don't want to hear a long promotion about how good it is to surf in Kuta. Avoid people who sells foods because they will stick to you like a glue until you get mad and tell them to get away.

Do NOT expect that Kuta is a perfectly-white beach like in the movies. Remember that Kuta is an international destination and probably thousands of people visit it daily, so don't freak out if you see litters on the sand.

Finally, it's unwise to come there unprepared because you'll eventually get thirsty, and if you don't have any drinks with you, you'll have to buy one from the drink seller which I've mentioned above, which brings me to my next and final matter: fraud. If you're a foreigner who barely knew what the Indonesian currency is, chances are you'll get tricked into paying more than normal. A usual drink in a bottle/can would normally cost 5.000-15.000 Rupiahs, so if they say a price exceeding 15.000, you'd better buy your drink elsewhere.

Of course, have fun and enjoy the beach!

ion for honeymooners. Right from the beautiful beaches, food, night life, temples etc everything seems to be interesting to visit.
Again ideal for people who like beaches, water sports.
Bali also offers private villas which are like these bungalows having private pool. After the hectic city visit one can relax in the pool in the evening followed by nice relaxed dinner.
Kuta offers a good range of street shopping and good place for night life. For Indian cuisine one can check Queens of India and Indian tandoor.
Another must see place is Ubad, which is know for its handmade and handicraft items. Ubad is also good for shopping.
The best part of the trip was 2 hour white water rafting which is like a breath of fresh air. After a one week you are rejuvenated and feels like a perfect holiday.
Connectivity is good Bali so one might even want to stay in transit destitution like Malaysia, Singapore.
Balinese currency is quite undervalued, hence you usually end up paying in lakhs for good food and good items.

Great beach if you are learning how to surf. Nice small to medium rollers coming in most mornings. Lots of places to rent boards and lessons. Not the cleanest beach but not the worst either. Practice here and then head to Canggu for a more locals type atmosphere. Shop and bars tend to be expensive in Kuta as this is the main drag in Bali. I stayed in Denpasar and then Seminyak . Managing a scooter with a surf board in tow is not an easy task, some scooters come with a kind of rack. The area was safe even late at night , nice resorts with pools at the end of Legian.

Its different beach. it's a straight beach. there is long area on same level so you can go deep inside the sea without much high waves, for very long area. its quite long beach also. But it's not clean...nor the send is white...as it's quite popular and crowded...It's not an exceptional beach. All kind of people moving...if you are exclusive beach freak better to avoid this beach but as it's one of the most talked tourist place everyone tends to go there.

I wasn't able to explore this beach because there was just too many people. Just saw the sunset. I've been to better beaches. Maybe the beach would have been more inviting if it was deserted. But then again a deserted spot is virtually non-existent in Kuta

Kuta beach is a lovely white-sand beach across the road from the main beachfront district of Kuta and the many hotels which attract international visitors. The hotels are generally good moderate prices and provide great service and food. The beach is expansive, the sea is beautifully blue and sunsets are exquisite. Unfortunately everybody agrees and at times the sand becomes very crowded and coming from the deserted sands of New Zealand we often felt pressured by the crowd. Also the beach is highly commercialised and its very hard to spend time in one place without being hassled to pay for towels, beach chairs, umbrellas and drinks. No sooner do you turn one trader down than another turns up looking for your cash. On top of that the beach is filled with itinerant sellers of souvenirs, sometimes questionable food, and a variety of other goods who will hassle insistently and invasively. So the beach is well worth a visit, but unless you are a surfer and can escape into the water, or pay your money to a franchiser with beach chairs who might protect you from the mob there might be more relaxing places to spend your day. Also the water is not always clean. Its a busy waterway and seems to have attracted a lot of plastic and rubbish pollution. Looking back of this I have not painted a very attractive picture, so I have to repeat that its a lovely beach, the water is blue, the sun is HOT, and there ARE plenty of facilities to help you enjoy your time there. But if you are looking for quiet relaxing time don't expect it all to occur on Kuta Beach.

Kuta beach was long, beautiful, but there was a lot of dirt. I don't know if it was temporary because of currant or its a constant thing for that place. I couldn't swim in the water because of the cigarets, plastic of all kind etc. Though the waves were good and wind servers didn't seem to bother. Lots of nice and not expensive restaurants.

My spouse and I are not beach people, nor do we surf. But our guide brought us here on a private tour of Lombok. We stayed only long enough to take in the expanse of sand and the waves crashing ashore. Then we went on to lunch. It you are not young and into the beach scene, it is best to skip this place.

I'm shocked that anyone would give this beach an excellent rating. The beach is crowded with tourists of course, but worse than that is the number of people begging you to buy things. "Do you want a massage/pedicure/soda/beer/lighter/towel/sarong/hat/hair braid/ etc." It's absolutely impossible to relax on this beach. Don't expect even one minute of peace to enjoy the view. Definitely not what I expected. Very disappointing.

Kuta is for young people who wants to eat, drink, shop and surfing. This beach is same like Kuta streets - full of people, shopping and sporting fatilities. The water is more Wilde and good only for surfing, not for swimming. Also it is low, than not so good for children (only during low tide). There are many local people who disturbe you for massage, sarong or fruit shopping and nail design. This beach is not for relaxing - if you need relaxing beach, go to Nusa Dua.

No matter how overrated it is, Kuta Beach still holds this title as "Bali's Must Visits", at least for me. I went to Kuta Beach for my very first surfing lesson. I loved it!!! I never knew how fun it was until I set my surfboard out in the sea. So yes, apart from being perfect for sunsets, this beach is also perfect for beginner surfers like me.

Kuta Beach in Bali is just awesome. Nice and romantic place to be with your partner. Nice weather. Nice Indonesian people selling small things at the beach. Lovely place to go

Sure you can get the sunset in this most famous beach in all Bali's history. In the past, this beach is very very crowded, with tourist from all over the world, with the beach seller or pedagang acung, with the lady massage, with the surf board rental, carpet rental, beach chair rental, drugs, gigolo, prostitutes and the beach bars selling alcohol. In the tourist seasons it's so so crowded, even in the noon which is very very hot......fantastic!

Today the beach surrounded by the walls, divide the beach with the road. The wall builds for some reasons, one is to prevent the road filled with sands when in the windy season. Reasonable....but these walls blocks your view from the road to the sea, so you can't see the sea from the road when you drive a car, it's too bad.....another reason is for security, but I don't know what security since you're in Bali......yes there is some criminal issues but not much.....

You're not visited Bali if you never come to Kuta beach......

The beach is so-so with gray sand.. but the strong and beautiful waves in the morning (when there aren't too many people yet) are just relaxing. I can sit there for hours (or from 7-9am only.. hahaha).

The beach gets crowded in the afternoon with peddlers and surfers. It's also nice to watch the surfers treading along and riding the waves.

A really great wide sandy beach. The water is not ideal for swimming with large waves but it is perfect for surfing! Lots of friendly people on this beach both locals and tourists. Lots of tourists from other Indonesian islands were asking to take photos with us which for us was not a problem but others it could be. Lots of local lads come here in the evenings to play football as the sun goes down. There are local traders offering drinks and massages on a regular basis which is nice but can get a bit annoying if you are trying to relax. But overall a really lively beach with lots of people and activity to watch or take part in.

You can play in the beach shore. You can learn to surf. You can make a good sunset foto. You can just run through the long beach line. or may be you can just hang out, eating meatballs, corn, lumpia, and drinks beers.

Kuta beach is conveniently located for a beginner to start learning to surf. It can be a little crowded in the water at times but it's still very workable.

The beach itself is full of vendors and may not be you cup of tea if you're looking for a quiet day at the beach. If you want to be at a busy beach then this is the place to be. And of course location is just steps away from all kinds of shopping whether upmarket or art markets and bargains, and places to eat and chill are aplenty.

Setting aside the local merchants trying to sell you things, sitting down and having a Bintang at one of the makeshift bars along the treeline of the beach was quite a chilled out experience.

This is a real happening place in Bali. If you are in Bali and a beach lover, you must be in Kuta. This is perhaps one of the top destinations of the world till date. I had been there only once in June 2012 and thoroughly enjoyed. The area in and around Kuta is so happening and so lively that unless you go there it will be difficult to appreciate. The nightlife is pretty good here. Variety of food (cuisines) available here are plenty from across the world. This place is food lovers deilght. For us, it was a family trip and we enjoyed thoroughly. But beware of pickpockets and exchange your money from trusted places only.

Whist VERY beautiful, every time I have been to Kuta beach I have been swooped upon by beach traders trying to sell me braclets and fake tattoos and sarongs etc.. They are very aggressive and hound you, never taking no for an answer. Some you have to yell at to make them leave you alone. Great if you want to surf or quickly check it out to say you have been then but otherwise keep a wide berth!

I arrived about 3pm just to be at the beach for few hours. the views of the beach at these hours are just like pictures you see in the travel books. sandy, sunny, umbrella with beach chars, cold beer, friends. watch people surfing, sun tanning.
there are a few minus points though, the beach doesn't have any lockers facility, so you need to think about your belongings. and there are some sellers who keep asking you to buy overpriced souvenirs even after you ve said no several times.

it would be a good after to have some food massage after your beach time. normally cost you about 15-20 USD per hour.

I was staying in Seminyak but would daily go for a long walk or run down to Kuta beach to see the daily circus that happens here all day long. This stretch of the beach is highly populated with heaps of surfers, surf schools, food vendors, pop up bars , tourists and locals. A good place to grab a cold beer and watch the surfers , sunset and people watch. You do get harrased a little by people trying to sell you all kinds of weird and wonderful things but a polite smile and a no thank you often sends them on their way.

I think everyone know about this beach, kuta is famed beach at bali. But i think the local people or government must be attention at the cleanliness and decisively to tourist who pollute this beach. I looking many garbage along the coast and I'm sure when this is from the visitors. And at midnight at here have may stupid dumb tourist who have hangover, they were scream out, reckless and they raced along the way.

Kuta is one of the popular Bali beaches as it is closer to market place and city center. So enjoy walking down from the market and enjoy the Blue Ocean... It is a long beach and to avoid crowd you may need to walk a bit more. Can enjoy many water sports, cruse, Diving etc at moderate prices. The scuba diving is great but a bit costly. Other fun are Fish Fly, Banana Boat, Speed water scooter etc.

But if you love to have the best view of overall Blue Ocean at Bali, I recommend to book your arrival in morning hours at about 8-9 am and request a window seat. The Arial view of the ocean is great and you enjoy the last 30-35 minutes of your flight at the most. Keep your camera ready and click. You can take big nice landscapes or zoom it to get specifics. Bali connects to India via Singapore or Kualalmpur and takes 2 hrs flight from Singapore.

It's just awesome to stroll on this stretch of sand (not white sand though, slightly brownish) but contrary to reports read online-it was very clean, spotless in fact). The waves are big and thunder in and you can see surfers trying to catch that elusive wave in the distance. This is a truly public beach, there's a wall partition running alongside with the road outside. No hotels have direct beach frontage. A trip to this beach is essential!

Beach is crowded but it is a nice experience, watching people surfing and just soaking under the sun. I must say that I find the beach dirty.

This is a lively beach. Lots of people and lots of hawkers. I think evening time is good to enjoy as the weather also cools down a little bit. Around 4-7 pm might be the best. Just soak yourself in the water and have fun watching people around :)

It is not a quiet, crystal clear water beach. It is a lively, full of people, have fun type of beach.

After having fun you can spend some romantic time at the door steps of Discovery Mall or have great food in the beautiful restaurants.

We specifically went to Kuta beach so the kids could take part in the turtle release. About 200 baby turtles were released & each child/adult was given a plastic container to carry their tiny turtle to the waters edge. The actual "ceremony " was a little tedious for the little ones as those conducting it spoke about their passion for saving the turtles for quite a long time. You cannot question their passion & commitment but for little kids it was hot & tiring. Participants are asked to make a small donation which goes to turtle rescue. Of course for us adults waiting on the beach we were subjected to the hundreds of hawkers peddling their wares. We paid for some plastic chairs & had drinks but found the massage ladies persistent! A great experience for the kids.

The beach is okay (meaning it's sandy, not rocky or coral-y, and it's plenty wide), and the waves seem great for surfers, but there are too many vendors and not enough places to swim if you're not surfing. The waves are great, though, and fun to body surf in.

Glad we visited Kuta for the experience but since we live in a beach-side tourist town back home, there were very few differences. The beach was nice. Vendors sold anything from alcohol to artwork on the beach and could be overwhelmingly pushy. Surfing lessons were very accessible. Shopping and dining were close by and bordered on village-like shopping to high end shopping. We had to pay to use the public restroom at the beach--otherwise, we were advised by different people to go use the bathroom in the water.

Had one of my best sunsets. The thing is, this beach is too full with tourists, local or non local. The water is not clear and many tourists didn't throw the garbage at the proper place.

Kuta beach is not white or crystal clear or empty. Its narrow a dusty light brown coarse sand and its full of hawkers and people who interupt your walk ever millisecond. There are surfers and its a pity the local sellers dont leave you alone just a little.
Indonesian people are very family orientated so all areas are family friendly and they might annoy the kids with there constant conversation starting but its harmless.

Our first visit to Bali was to Kuta beach. It worths to spend a day in the huge sandy beach of Kuta. Coffee shops and restaurants located along the beach are very romantic and can not be compared with the chaos that exists outside the beach. It worths to see the sunset. Very romantic destination!

Really nice beach. The traffic on the way there from Seminyak was horrible but the beach was pleasant and kind of quiet. We took surfing lessons on the beach which was a lot of fun. The waves are a great size to learn on. Hard Rock is right on this beach too.

I come from Perth, Australia. We have some of the most amazing beaches here, so I can't compare them. I do like that I can sit at the beach and someone will bring me a drink if I want one, but I really do not like being hassled so much by hawkers. I know it is part and parcel with going to Bali, but it gets very tiresome. I spend less by staying by the hotel pool, because I am on holiday, trying to relax, I don't want to be pressured relaxing at the beach.

Although we didn't really swim or spend that much time on the beach and in the water, the kids were nonetheless thrilled to chase the waves as they roll in. It's a long beach and most people will be able to enjoy themselves there. Only irritating thing is the multitude of touts trying to seek your attention to patronise their service! Even on the roads...just hated the cabs and private transports honking to catch tourists' attention....simply spoil the beauty and serenity of this otherwise laid back area.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,464,40>===============  
We regularly went to Rudi's bar on the beach to watch the sunset & loved the casual service....you sit on plastic chairs anywhere in the sand & order your drinks which are delivered quickly. Lots of hawkers but they are friendly & although sometimes persistent, still a lot of fun. They are normally finished by 6ish which is a good time to go.

This is like the old Bali with friendly locals peddling their goods. Everyone is friendly and people are laughing and joking with tourists and each other. It is clean, well organised and without leaving the beach you can buy food, drinks, a sun hat ,and, of course, a watch !!! Many places have been so sanitised that you could be in any warm place but this is a little touch of Old Bali.

My first Beach experience of was amazing. As seen in the films n photographs the images of the beach was the most beautiful thing was in my mind. The Kuta Beach was really so close to nature. The best time to enjoy the Beach moments was In Early Morning & Evening time. I really love to see sun set n sun rise. Really a very good experience.

I had been wary of visiting Kuta beach based on the mixed reviews I saw on here but this beach is beautiful! As most people have said, there are quite a lot of people selling things (from fruit to massages to everything in between) but a polite "No, thank you" is all you need and they will leave you alone.

The beach itself is picturesque, with white sand and the beautiful blue ocean, and it is perfect for a relaxing afternoon. You can rent your own chair and umbrella from the ladies selling them on the beach but remember that you can barter for a lower price than what they originally ask for. There is also surf boards and lessons, and a surf board costs only 80,000 rp for a couple of hours. The men selling the surf boards are also very nice and they invite anybody to sit with them for free, if you so want.

When the tide is low you can go into the ocean and chase waves, as the waves are quite big! When the ocean is too rough you can't swim but it is perfect for surfing.

Overall this is one of the best beaches I went to while on my trip to Bali. Although it is catered towards tourists (and the restaurants in the area are quite expensive), you don't need much to enjoy this beautiful beach.

Now that I have your attention I will encourage everyone to just pick up a little bit of plastic when you see something while getting up from the water and back to the sand. I see so many reviews mentioning seing trash at the beach - why not get rid of it then. Seriously guys it's not that hard to do this and you'll be a hero to so many sea-living creatures just by not ignoring the trash laying around. There are trash cans by the exits, so there's no excuse. Makes me really sad to see all the plastic and bottles and noodle bags during low-tide, and literally - if everyone picked up ONE piece each the beach would be clean every day and even more beautiful than it already is. "Thank you" - newly hatched turtles and the rest of the environment.

And now for the experience. Since we are staying close to the beach we've been here a lot. The sand is soft and good to lay on, and you can get beds if you pay around 50k p/h. The surfboard rents are good, 50k for 2 hours and the people are always friendly and smiling. When people try to sell us things such as fruit, ice cream or bracelets we just say no thanks and smile, don't spend energy being annoyed by them. The ice cream is really good tho. The surf is best by high tide (duh), not only because of the waves, but theres less inexperienced surfers and more locals surfing earlier in the morning - they know to get a good wave. Around 1-2pm it's crowded with all sorts of people - some swimming, some surfing, some just laying on a surfboard doing nothing in the middle of the water blocking your surfpath and then getting pissed when you hit them and so on. Nobody cares about swimming between the flags, or not surfing between the flags, but just take a look around before going into the water - make sure there are no surfers right in front of you and no one will get hurt :) A really good place to hang out and just chill!

We sat at G'Day bar, which is a pop up bar on Kuta Beach.
Gede, who runs this bar is very friendly and great to have a chat with...perfect setting to just sit on the beach, have a few drinks and watch the sunset.

Only annoying thing for me ? The locals selling items on the beach. Some do not leave you alone, so patience can be a little tested at times if you want peace and quiet whilst enjoying a Bintang.

The sunset is really good and if you like cheap Bintang beer then you are ok, but you cant relax and enjoy it as you are constantly pestered. Everything from souveniers to massage is available but you have to haggle. Its fun at first but gets on your nerves after a bit. Its the same in the streets in Kuta, relentlessly pursued by people selling things and incessant peeping of taxi horns. On the plus side you can get decent manicures, pedicures and massages at the many spas at really cheap rates. It was an experience but not one I would want to repeat.

I prefer quiet and unpopular beaches so Kuta Beach is not my thing. But we went there for a jog and practice surfing at 6 a.m., it was still pretty quiet. Come sunset though, it gets crowded especially during peak season. There are a LOT of vendors and sellers trying to make a living. Just be nice and say "No" if you're tired or haggle if you are ready. ;) If you are nice to one of the locals, they'll give you good price for the rest of your stay and even tell you local prices for shirts and massages.

Kuta beach is a beach for surfing. Near Grand Inna kuta hotel, you will find a 10 meter wide part of the beach with 2 flag poles. This is the swimming area. Lifeguards will call your attention if you stray outside the flags. Early in the day, the beach is used by sun bathers and surfers.

Later in the afternoon, tourists flock to see the amazing sunset at the beach. We took a photo of the sun which looked liked a fireball held by a hand. Be prepared to take a leisurely walk along this long beach. Lookout for the Beachwalk shopping mall, as you cross the street about 500 meters from the hotel.

Too many people trying to sell things and rent chairs. Also on the way taxis will bother you and follow you. There's no reef which makes it a bit treacherous for small children that want to swim, but good waves for surfers if you don't mind being haggled. View isn't all that great, but honestly growing up on an island myself with secluded white beaches has made me slightly biased. So it's really up to you to see for yourself, but not for me, as it was somewhat busy and being pestered not stop was annoying.

The well-known beach in Bali. Unfortunately, if you expect such clean beach, don't go here because there were many trash around by the time I visit.

A must to enjoy the Bali experience. The hardworking Balinese people that walk the beach everyday are just beautiful people if you let yourself spend time and relax and you too will find out how wonderful these ladies and men are. Their memory is just amazing and their quirky sense of humour is funny, My advise is take a stroll just before sunset pick a chair and buy a drink from some of the most charming funny guys. Enjoy the attention from the lovely beach ladies. A manicure is a must. We visited in Oct and again in April and some of the ladies actually remembered us. Pretty amazing seeing how many thousands of people visit the beach. We visited the beach every night just for an hour at the end of everyday. Sure the the balinese sellers are persistent but seriously they work really long hours with not much return. So support them and take the time to just enjoy a beautiful sunset.

So walking onto the beach was hard enough with all the scammers and sellers hounding you (they don't give up easily!) once you make your way through the living hell of sellers and finally sit down, another onslaught of sellers putting hats on your kids, sunglasses, trying to get you to buy viagra, blow darts and paintings. I think I told each of them at least 10 times NO, NOT INTERESTED, GO AWAY yet they don't give up. My family lasted about 25 minutes on the beach before giving up and going back to our villa lol

At my visit i saw a tractor with sand cleaner by which took all debris and garbages from the beach, that made it more enjoyable than before. One thing that surprised me, I found a beach walk path about 3 kms along the beach from north to south. The path had been paved and located next to beach white sand.

The beach itself is not too bad by today's Bali standards. There is little rubbish on the beach! The problem is the endless stream of locals trying to sell things who were relentless from the second we stepped onto the beach until we left. We went to relax but found the experience really stressful. After being hassled to rent a beach lounger, we walked off and sat down on the sand only to hassled again.

Don't believe that these people take no for an answer because they don't!

After going for a beer so we could sit on a plastic seat and get some shade, we were swarmed yet again by sellers because we had bought a beer. We couldn't relax and just enjoy it.

At one point we had 6 people surrounding us. The beer seller wasnt at all bothered that his customers were being hassled. After 2 hours of constant hassle I was ready to snap! I wouldn't recommend anyone going here unless you are going to surf.

Kuta beach has beautiful views, especially when present at sunset. The beach is clean, and the water is pretty clear. However the salespeople you usually see on the streets of Kuta and Legian are swarming; condos felt walking past people and trying to sell ice creams, kites, etc. Would be better to go in the water and avoid these people rather than sitting on the sand.

We were in Kuta for 2 days and tried a number of eateries on the water front and in the next street. I had a lovely lobster meal at one place which was a A$5 per 100g ($15). Jamie Oliver opened a restaurant just as we were leaving, we came back today and tested it out. Food fantastic but prices very high. We ate lots of Indonesian food which I love.

Yes lovely beach, hundreds of surfers out on the reef for the surf break, hundreds of people laying on the beach, lots of options to hire boards, be sold many different wares, massages, nail painting and drink but not many in the water swimming. Why, because the under currents, especially when we were there were crazy and dangerous. Yes there were lifeguards but my picture tells a thousand stories. We lifeguard in Australia so are fully aware of rips, currents, whats safe and whats not and the 2 days we visited Kuta beach would not be safe for general swimmers.

We did swim between the flags and the kids had a great time but were constantly going in the water at 1 side of the flags and coming in on the other.

Sunset was definitely worth going down for if you can get past the thousands waiting by the path to see it. Worth a visit.

I should preface this review with the fact that my husband and I are not really "beach people". We don't want to sit on the beach all day long. If you feel the same, then Kuta beach is actually a pretty good spot for you. It was a little busy but still plenty of room to find a comfortable space. There are lots of little Warung's nearby as well as street cart food. There is also decent shopping nearby (trinket/market wares as well as beachwalk bali mall). As part of an afternoon out, Kuta beach is pretty decent. If you're looking to be at the beach all day I would probably find a place a little more private/quiet.

Well our first trip to Bali was in 1991 so we have seen many changes to Bali. Kuta beach however is sort of a constant, yes it's got busier, the skyline along the beach has changed and is ever changing. However, I still love the sunsets, a cold beer at Adi's Aussie Spot (Opposite the Mecure on Jalan Pantai Kuta) Kuta Beach is a people magnet, the beach is a lot cleaner than it used to be and the surf still pounds in. It's not everyone's favourite spot but each to there own.

Oh yes, please beware of your personal belonging because i lost my speck and my slipper seriously just in a seconds i left it.

Kuta Beach isnt the best beach in Bali but its crowded with people surfing and great for hanging out and having a party.

Waves are pretty decent for wave surfing. The whole stretch of the beach is lined with stalls and surf lessons on offer. Many instructors will approach you asking for surf lessons. Gets annoying after a while. Trick is to walk further down towards the water. Less likely to bother you.

Go to the beach at night and enjoy the cool breeze and sound of the crashing waves.

Not exactly a clean beach, but not very dirty either.

A fantastic clean beach and promenade, compared with the way it was 30 years ago, when we first visited Bali. The promenade runs from the airport to the art centre near Matahari - about 3.2km. Nice walk but you may have to dodge some friendly beach sellers - beats walking along Jalan Kartika. Well worth a visit to Kuta Beach.

We went to the beach in the evening just for a stroll. It was not much crowded at that time but found it unclean. What I actually liked was the market and eating joints on the road leading to the beach. The whole area is very lively. Food is good and all kinds of restaurants with different cuisines and sea food can be found here. We had italian dinner and it was nice. Overall, more than the beach we enjoyed on the market and eateries lane.

Busy but clean sandy beach with a plenty of sunbeds and parasols. Nice waves for beginner surfers, although usually very busy and the unbroken waves can close out very quickly. Lots of places to rent surfboards and vendors selling cheap Bintang beer and providing a seat to watch the sunset.

Arrive at 10 pm on the beach. Feel silent and quiet place, there's not many people enjoying the night and the stars. Nothing to do, just hear the sound of the waves and seeing stars. Safe place to spend the night and relaxing.

A stroll along Kuta beach in the blazing Bali sun is lovely on any day . Throw in a couple of cold Bintangs and this is living . With all the bats , surf shacks and golden sand , Kuta beach is a great place to spend a lazy day . The water temp is like a warm bath and the sunset at the end of the day is amazing . See it for yourself you won't be disappointed.

Nothing is more distressing than seeing these poor horses standing with their cart in the diect sun in extreme heat all day and night. All this for carting lazy people or totally insensitive people who have obviously no care for these poor creatures. I would see these malnourished horses foaming and their tongue hanging out of their mouth and literally dying of thirst.
When I approach the driver to literally beg him to give the horse water they simply say they can't afford water for them. So I would run across the road and buy water only to find the bucket they do have for the poor horse is small and it can barely drink from it.
It broke my heart even to the point where I was crying to see this poor horse desperately slurping all the water.
These people ride these horses in peak hour traffic with fat lazy people in the cart and you can see the horses are in distress.
When will Balinese people realise that western educated people find this as cruelty and it makes our trip miserable. This practice needs to stop. I beg all those who go and see this to tell these idiots its cruelty and to get some water for the poor horses and to tell the twits to stop this inhumane practice.

Kuta beach is great a great place to grab a few Bintangs and chat to the locals. Many people say that the beach is filthy but in realty the beach is cleaned daily by machine and the local hawkers, however during the monsoon season Dec to March the Javanese rivers flood and wash mountains of rubbish directly on to Kuta beach the local authorities try to keep up but cannot cope. So if you want to enjoy Kuta Beach at it's best stay clear of the monsoon season.

I actually like this beach because the hotels are separated from it by a street and a very well done wall with openings every several meters. Comfort rooms are also available which is very good.
The beach is long and the sand, though not white, is nice to the feet.
What I did not like about it is that the whole stretch where the trees are is mostly teeming with vendors. The space should have been reserved for the tourists.

If you have ever been to other beaches, this beach would disappoint you. It's very dirty, garbage is all over the place. If you walk farther up toward Seminyak, you'll see a little stream of what smells like sewer. It's good people watching with all the bars on the beach but I would not swim there.

i liked the concept of the wall between the Beach and the road and rest of the city..the advantage would be that all the waste of bags and paper wont fly on to the beach from the city and will keep the beach clean.. volcanic sands so its not a white sand beach if you expecting that.. but its really good place to just stroll around and loads of wendors are around there who would sale you things if you are thirsty or hungry ..

I read a lot of reviews that said the beach was dirty, and I absolutely did not find that to be the case at all. The sand is not pure white because Bali being a volcanic island, but it was certainly clean when I was there.

There are lots of trees on the beach which provide a nice shade if you want to walk along the back. My son had a great time here with some surfing lessons. I found that you cannot walk without being pestered by beach vendors which Is really the only thing that stops it being a five star review.

If you want a deserted beach with pure white sands then this is not the place for you, but I thought it was good and certainly better than I expected.

I find it hard to understand the reviews on here that describe Kuta Beech as 'Paradise' with its 'Golden Sands and Crystal Blue water'. Either they have never been to another beach before or the are working for Bali tourism.

I imagine that Kuta beach is the perfect place if you want to go surfing. The waves look fantastic and there are so many people offering 'surf lessons'. I would just recommend doing some research first because there is obviously a range of quality on offer here.

For someone like myself who see the beach as a great opportunity to go and relax on the sands whilst enjoying the sea breeze and an occasional dip in the water, this really isn't the place to go.

From the second you step in the beach, you are hassled from every angle. Bintang, ice cream, massage, towels, fake watches etc etc. I'm not exaggerating when I say every two minutes someone was bothering you. If you are asleep they will wake you too.

The big waves make the sea less fun for swimming or just relaxing with a quick dip.

The sands here are vast, but that doesn't stop them from getting incredibly crowded. Towards the end of the day, everyone gathers to watch the sunset on the beach which is nice the first time but definitely not spectacular enough to warrant the number of people who gather for this.

I write this on behalf of my son currently in Kuta reporting how bad it is as a single person visiting, and who is 30+. I write this in the hope that the Bali tourist office see this and does something.

He has travelled though Thailand and Malaysia enjoying the people and experience, but, on arriving in Kuta, the past 3 days he had pre-booked accommodation for have been ruined by constant cocaine pushers openly offering drugs to single people, and watching single girls being given unpleasant, similar, and worse attention.

It his last day there and he has been pushed drugs every day, had attempts at having his phone stolen and generally been targetted by various scams to get money out of him.

Bali is the last step of his trip and he was looking forward to it, Kuta being the point of arrival by air, gvies a bad impression to the whole island. We know that away from the built-up area the local people are great and caring.

Given the recent execution of the 9 for drug offences, we are surprised the drug pushing was so blatant and open.

So, if you are going solo to Bali, beware of Kuta. Unfortunately it seems to attract those looking for drugs.

You can either walk on sands or loiter along the beach main road, the traffic here is frequently in a state of chaos. From 8 a.m. up to 9 p.m.;It is always jam-packed with cars or motorbikes, sometimes you can even see some hot-headed motorists rush out to drive on the narrow pavement . Tourists like to take pictures before some scenic spots, such as Discovery shopping mall, Hard Rock hotels, Beachwalk etc., Many hotels along the beach flagged a slogan "recommended hotel by Tripadvisor", I really wondered. The beach is good for surf-riding and swimming , but the sand may be too hot during daytime. Many tourists lie on sands for sun-bathing or reading , it is a paradise for relaxation.

An excellent beach that begins by Discovery shopping Mall and stretches far up the coast. The beach itself is very good but the sand gets very hot. It's lined with lots of tiny little bars run by friendly locals offering refreshments. There are a lot of Hawkers selling there wares but if you are polite but firm they get the picture. They may be offering something you would like though . The sea has strong currents and waves so always swim between the flags and take local advice.

The last time I was in this particular beach was 12 years ago and it was such a pretty beach where you had one of those unforgettable experiences. Last April I finally got to see the beach again after such a long time because I've been too focused on the Seminyak area every time I was in Bali. I don't know what happened but it was so dirty and the only thing I could think of back then was that the reputation is all that's left of this once iconic beach. Sure it's still crowded every day but I figure that has more to do with the surrounding shopping area than with the beach itself. I wish the local authority paid more attention to the maintenance of such popular destination.

Unfortunately it appears locals just toss their trash onto the beach. We watched time and again locals just throwing wrappers or empty bottles onto the beach as they were walking along. The trash seems to accumulate really badly around the surfing instructors and fishing boats where a lot of locals hang around all day. We were taking surfing lessons and actually had to push trash out of the way in order to paddle. We had the same problem with snorkeling at Nusa Dua. I would have given it 2 points but the views are beautiful. The best time to walk along the beach to avoid trash is very early in the morning.

Not a very deep beach but incredibly clean & what a panorama!! It seems to stretch endlessly. The sea is so clean you can see the bottom. It is a gentle drop which makes it safe for non swimmers too.

During the wet season this beach gets a lots of rubbish in the water and washed on the beach. this beach has waves and lots of places to hire a body board or surf board.

If you are lucky and it is the right time of year you might even get to release a baby turtle. Look for the big Turtle near HeadQuarters and the Life Savers.

At times there are cremations on this beach so always be respectful if you see a ceremony in process.

if you want to escape the hustle and bustle of the kuta streets then this is not the place for you. many beach bars are setup along the beach which is great if you want to have a drink. HOWEVER the beach pedallers ruin it, there are many of them and they are persistent, like a pack of wolves smelling out fresh meat, they surround and then hound until you get your nails done, have a massage or buy some of the little trinkets they have to sell. Once you get over the initial tidal wave of pedallers they seem to leave you alone and let you sit back and relax (until another comes along looking for the left overs)

Nice to watch the waves but there are signs warning about dangerous rips. If you do swim here make sure you swim where the signs say is safe, people drown here when they don't obey the signs.

Ive walked along the waters edge and its nice but the rubbish is a worry and I kept my eye out for broken glass. At the waters edge the beach sellers tend to mostly leave you alone. Closer to the walkway they will try to sell their wares. Make sure you check what they sell you for quality as they often have the watches that don't work and the wood carvings with bugs inside.

The beach was filthy. Covered in rubbish with no evidence that anything is being done about it. Sadly litter generally in Indonesia doesn't seem to be an issue that is being addressed as everywhere I have been has the same problem.

This place was too dirty in the morning to have an idea to swim there-plastic bags,bottles,rubbish..... Each morning balinese people were cleaning it. Each!!!Once u entered the ocean-u walk 2-3 m in rubbish. Maybe because it was windy season but anyway it was a shock for me.
Surfing is quite good but as there are several surfing schools on the spot crowds of people are in the water and thus making surfing not fun but struggle.
My opinion-if u come to Bali to have close connection with nature-water-sun-surfing-choose other region. The farer from airport and crowds-the better.

I have been asked to share this to help others in Bali. Last Sunday night 12th April my husband (regular visitor to bali) was giving my 69 year old Aunty a lift to her hotel on his scooter. As they entered into Melasti St (from kuta beach) a bike with 2 people approached my husbands bike very close. The passenger on this bike was trying to take my aunty's bag from her arm. My husband and aunty were flown from their bike. My husband was unconscious on the road and my aunty was injured. Thankfully local balinese helped get my husband and aunty to Siloam Hospital. A hospital i would never reccommend (that is another story). My Aunties injuries were lacerations to her face and body and a broke shoulder. My husbands skull was fractured along with a bleed, broken shoulder, broken collar bone, 3 broken ribs and lacerations to his body. My aunty flew back to melbourne a few days later for medical treatment and my husband thanks to our Travel Insurance Company (TID) was air ambulance to Perth Trauma Unit. We are all back in Melbourne now thankfully and have lots of healing to do. We are very frequent travelers to Bali we read about this as it is rampant in bali atm but we never think it could happen to us. Please take care travelers in Bali. I don't think I would ever carry a handbag in Bali again it just makes us an easy target for this crime. An expat friend that came to visit in the hospital shared with me a few weeks ago she was targeted on her bike with scissors. I always wear my bag across my body I guess it doesnt really matter anymore.

Beach was clean while I was there (13 - 17 April). Even spotted a team of litter pickers and a sweeping truck cleaning the beach in the morning. Looks like they take good care of the beach. The sand settles really fast so the water is surprisingly clear for a beach with waves. And the shore is wide so you could go out in the water for 500 metres and still stand with the water about your waist. I love that!

Took a surfing lesson there too. Small waves in the morning make perfect conditions for beginners like me. It was great fun! But as usual, being a touristy place, hawkers will haunt you to get a beach chair or an ice cold beer.

Sat here for a few hours last Saturday. A cold beer under the shade of an umbrella followed by a paddle in the warm Java Sea. Almost perfect ! If it wasn't for the fact that we were pestered every few minutes to buy hats, sunglasses, Rolex (!) watches and massages, this would have got 5 out of 5. I mean you do try to politely say no (a lot) but the vendors just stand next to you, saying nothing, and making you feel a little uncomfortable.

I went to kuta beach to look at the surf, that it all. To watch the waves. Instead I was, in an instant a clothes rack for sarongs and bickering women all shouting at me at once. I walked back out on the street and went back in another entrance.....same thing happens. I also have long hair so u couldn't walk anywhere without people asking to braid my hair, honestly I wouldn't get my hair braided if you paid me, I refused every time but it's like 'no thanks' was not a part of the local vocabulary. It was highly frustrating. We walked up much further past all the beach resorts and found a nice little beach hotel restaurant, there looked like there was no one around so we stopped for drinks. It was pleasant and relaxing for about 5 minutes.....then all the outdated souvenirs came out, friendship bracelets, mini wooden surfboards, buddahs, ugh the list goes on and on. All I wanted was to sit and watch the damn surf with a drink.... Then I hear behind me "you want hair braid! You want nails done?" Never again ever, ever again. Kuta beach would be a great spot to relax if you were just left alone. This unfortunately is never going to be a possibility.

Enter the beach at the main gate and it's a fair walk to the right to find some sunbeds to hire
However head to the back of the beach to find the beer (and water ughhh) sellers, the guy will give you a seat in the shade along with others and a good chitchat will commence
Great fun and one beer will become two then three then .... Ten !
A £1 beer with a 30 min £3 neck n shoulder massage ... Bliss

Our first night in Bali, a stroll along the beach, I tripped over two lumps of concrete when walking to one of the exits, yes it was dark and i didn't put my torch on, however it was a clear route, and close to the exit. They stood out of the ground about 300mm and were about 250mm square.... "Accident" Use your torch!

Later in our Holiday i relaxed and watch my wife and brother surfing, they are amateur by far and the waves were about 1.5-2M, there is swimming areas, and boards for hire, chairs, beds and parasols, beach sales people, trees, and an attempt to clean the beach on a small scale.... There was lots of waste washed up on the shore line.

We recently visited the Bali Beach Shack this is owned I believe by some fellow aussies....for anyone visiting Bali for the first time this is definitely a must...We were thoroughly entertained a fantastic drag show ...The people running the show were casual, professional and made you feel right at home....highly recommended ...

This is a very long beach. Volcanic sand which makes the sea lok dirty but it isnt. Couldnt swim on our visit as it was too windy / rough. Many touts. Get petered alot. Great sunset. Gets bust at sunset time as everyone discends down to the beach as the sun cools down.

There is the option to hire a surf board and take a lesson with one of the locals. For my family it was enough just to body surf in the waves and enjoy the impressive, long beach.

Crowded, and very dirty Kuta Beach is not worth visiting. Overall I found Kuta and Legian to be about the worst place I have ever been to in all my travels. Crowded,dirty and so much hassle from the locals it drove me mad. The locals will not leave you alone, they are always trying to sell you something actually grabbing you and trying to pull you into their shops. Then there are the cries of massage massage from the girls and then every guy on their bikes asking" ÿou want transport boss, you want girl boss". Very expensive now compared to the rest of Asia.

You can just have fun catching the waves. The locals are friendly. They also teach you how to safely swim by the waves. You can just leave your things by the beach while enjoying the sea. It's safe and nobody will get it. There are food shops everywhere so it's easy when you get hungry. :)

Kuta Beach was the most famous beach in Bali, but as time goes by, it's no longer again as the most famous beach. In my opinion, Kuta Beach has transformed, from beautiful beach into a dirty beach. The reason why Kuta is little bit dirty, because it's full of food seller, etc. and there are so many local visitors who put their trash everywhere.
It's good to visit, but it's not good anymore to swim there.

This is a nice piece of beach with lifeguards, surfing and rental possibilities for chairs.

I was impressed that you can buy food and drink on the beach and the fact that people selling stuff like beads or blow guns is way down now.

The surf is always good and the water reasonably clean.

Kuta beach is one of the most happening beach in Bali. The waves are good and you is the best beach for surfing. You can rent surfing board at the beach only and also take the surfing coaching. Not the cleanest of the beach with street dogs moving freely but if you are in Bali for surfing then this is the beach you should go to. The road outside has good restaurants and even the nightlife is good in near by areas.

Kuta Beach has far too many hasslers and it is quite dirty. We spent over a week in Kuta and never once spent the day on the beach it was much nicer to just stay at the pool in our hotel which is a shame.

Kuta Beach is perhaps the most famous beach in Bali, well located in the heart of Kuta and near many of the big hotels and restaurants in the Kuta area. It is a large beach that goes on for miles and becomes Legion Beach and then onwards to Seminyak, Kerobokan and so on. There is a row of trees and bushes at the top of the beach where you can have snacks, drinks or a massage and even buy souvenirs and clothes such as sarongs, shorts, bikinis and cheap jewellery. The beach is cleaned early morning every single day. Swim between the flags in the designated areas as the undertow of the rip currents can be deceptively strong. Life guards are present as are lifesaving canoes and surfboards. Surfboards can be hired on the beach and surf lessons are available for those who want to learn.

Kuta Beach is a bit like Patong Beach in Phuket. Its the main tourist beach area in Bali & is a hive of activity. The beach is quite dirty at times, however they are tractors that clean it each morning along with numerous people walking around picking up or raking the rubbish into piles . However this forgotten very quickly when you take in the beauty of your surrounds. There are numerous Bars along the beach offering cold beer and soft drinks.... however I've been told that from 1st April, 2015 it will be no longer legal to sell alcohol on the beach or in the 7/11 or Circle K ...... Not sure how that is going to impact on the Beach & locals. There is no better place to sit and watch the Sunset, it is Spectacular and my favourite way to end the Day!!! Everyone that goes to Bali has to go to Kuta Beach.... Its a MUST!!!

This beach is definitely the most renowned beach in entire Bali. To prove that, there is multitude of foreigners and locals present here. The waves here differentiate in height so it is a good place for beginning and advanced surfers alike. Presence of malls around Jalan Pantai Kuta means that you can play at the beach and enjoy mall at the same visit. However, the facilities (such as beach chairs) are quite overpriced (I was asked 100,000 Rupiah for 2 chairs), so try to negotiate the price. Also, it is very hot during the day, so make sure you have adaquate sun protection on. The beach is surprisingly clean due to their hard efforts. Overall, nice beach but not suitable for long-time visits. Be aware of hawkers trying to offer you massage or manicure services.

When I was here in 2007, the beach is pretty clean.

However on my return in 2015, the sight was horrible. It is dirty and it seems like the local government is not interested in keeping it clean.

Kuta beach has the advantage of having a long shoreline and deep beach but if it continue left neglected, it will no longer be a surfer paradise.

The long stretch of Kuta beach is separated from the road by a wall, apparently erected to reduce the rate of motor-vehicle accidents (drivers would turn to look at surfers and the waves, and not look at the motorcycles in front of them!!).

The beach is nice enough. I did not see much rubbish as mentioned in other reviews, maybe because i arrived just after the beach had been cleaned? The water too, although not crystal clear, was not dirty either.

The main attraction of the beach is actually the surfers. They add to the 'scenery' while riding the waves. And you can also see ngurah rai airport from here, so you get great photos of surfers in the foreground, and a plane descending in the background.

The surf here is meant to be easy, perfect for beginners. Hence, the large number of surf schools. Probably not much of an attraction for seasoned surfers.

There are lots of deck chairs under umbrellas along the beach. As soon as you step on to the beach, someone will ask you whether you'd like to sit/lie on the chairs. Ofcourse they'll charge you for it. There are also lots of peddlers selling their trinkets. They take a simple no for an answer and dont hassle you afterwards.

For food & drinks, there are plenty of restaurants along the road - local food, fast food, gelato, hard rock cafe and Beachwalk Shopping mall.

The beach gets really hot which is great for sun worshippers, but too hot for children. But it's a cool beach. I havent to the other bali beaches yet. So i have nothing to compare. Still worth a visit i think.

Kuta beach is famous with its friendly waves and beautiful sunset. But nowadays, this place becomes overly crowded (perhaps because this is the must visit beach at Bali), and people just simply throw their trash at the beach.
I went there yesterday (one day before Nyepi) when there were less people go to the beach. Surprisingly, this beach returned to a clean and silence beach. The sunset was so beautiful even it was covered by the clouds.
Well, there is nothing to lose for visiting this beach.

I recently move to bali and go there like twice or 3 times a week for a walk, from one end near hard rock to another end near seminyak and back. Way more fun rather than doing it at the gym (plus it's free). And you can't beat the beautiful sunset in kuta, so amazing I can't never get enough of it.

Kuta beach is Beautiful. When we arrived in Bali on the 12th March 2015 we went to the beach in the morning. Due to the tide being very low, a lot of rubbish had washed up on the beach which was quite sad to see because we are frequent visitors. But within 15 minutes the rubbish had all been cleaned up by the beach cleaners and the beach was beautiful again.

If you are heading to Kuta Beach, we recommend going to sit at Moly Bar directly across the road from Hard Rock Hotel if you want to have a drink. Lovely people and not pushy at all!!

There is a lot of sales people on the beach trying to sell bracelets, smokes, massages, mani/pedi, hair beading, bow and arrows, wooden puppets etc, but if you kindly tell them you don't want to buy anything, they will leave you alone. We all need to remember that this is their way of life and they are trying to support their families.

Kuta Beach is amazing. I have been there many times and will continue to go back.

have to agree with others that kuta beach is not that perfect, like what it is pictured online. but still it attract thousands of tourists every day. even in the morning people already doing activities here, either jogging or just walking or swimming.

The taps and the toilets is located near the Life Guard Station.The wave are nice , the water may not be blue but it nice to take a swim . You can get to see people surfing Bargain 1st before sitting on the sun deck chairs as you will be charged .

Unless you are an Australian backpacker completely intoxicated, I'd recommend avoiding this place. Its too busy, too chaotic to be peaceful. Bali is filled with great beaches this one is really more a place to strut around and shop then relax. Much of a hassle too with all the touts and scammers!

Kuta's beach may not be the most beautiful in Bali but it's certainly one of the most entertaining. No matter what time you go there there's something to do, watch or buy. The sellers are plentiful but pleasant and you can just about buy anything (a polite "no thank you" is enough for them to move on).

Go down there at sunset and buy an ice cold Bintang from one of the countless cool box vendors. The price includes a plastic chair to watch the sun go down - wonderful!

My least favourite area of Bali. The view of the sunset is outstanding, one of the best you can see. But that was the highlight of our stay. The beach itself is absolutely filthy, garbage everywhere like I have never seen before. You can't take a step in the water without becoming wrapped up in rubbish. The locals also hound visitors on the beach worse than any place I've been. They do not leave you alone. They followed our group of people for over 10 minutes after we politely declined their services and items many times. I suppose if your purpose is to surf and party (ours was not) it's a top destination, since we saw loads of surf shops, bars, and Australians with surfboards. We couldn't wait to leave Kuta.

kuta is one of the most popular tourist places in bali. besides a very long coast line it has a variety of restaurants offering cuisines from all over the world. street parallel to the beach has restaurants, shopping plazas, small utility shops and other tourist requirements like foreign exchange. there is vast variety for shopping, eating, getting massage, tattoo etc. the beach has become quite dirty because of the number of tourist, one can feel the left over plastic and garbage in your feet on the sea coast. one can see people surfing on the beach so facilities for surf board, sitting chairs etc are easily available on the beach front. not one of those clear blue water clean peaceful beaches but yes full of life with so many tourists and vendors around

First thought that entered my mind when I initially laid eyes on this beach was how dirty this place was. Granted, Kuta is a busy place full of tourist, and it is hard to clean up after all those people. But it is these people that mess up a beautiful place. This is the beach that I did learn how to surf so it has a place in my soul for that.

I will be back in Bali, but I will try other beaches in those future visits.

I visited Kuta for 4 days. After hearing good things about this beach, I was excited to go there. Once I had got past all of the people trying to sell things and got onto the beach, it couldn't have been further from my expectations! The whole beach was filthy, rubbish everywhere, dead fish along the sand and dogs running around doing their business in the sand. I walked about 10 minutes then had to leave, it was awful!

Being a public beach, it attracts alot of visitors daily. The locals are all out in flocks water skiing. Tourists who are there gets alot of attention from vendors, massuers and locals who just want to make friends.

Beach is not like what you see in tv. There is no clear blue water and all. The shoreline is filled with rubbish and there are workers cleaning up the beach for the tourist season. I saw a Water snake and wonder how can people swim in these water.

I would recommend not taking a hotel at Kuta as it is crowded with tourists and all. Best to look at other areas at bali such as Saminyak and all as I am sure the beaches there would be clean and clear as it is not so crowded. I saw some people surfing but only in small waves.

If you want to learn surfing, taste local food then shop afterwards, this is the place! There are surfing courses offered in the area, in fact there are so many people of different age learning the craft in this beach as the waves aren't that big.

The beach itself looks ok, probably good for a surf.

This beach has a lot of people wandering through it. It is popular with the locals and tourists. You can either sit on the ground or buy a drink from one of the local vendors who offers plastic chairs for people to relax in exchange for purchasing a drink.

Nice beach, good waves, can be dirty. Great for sunsets. There is less in the way of nature or scenery than Bali's other beaches, but it's easier to access from the tourist area, abuts numerous swanky resorts, and features lots of surf board and beach umbrella vendors. Can be hard to get to before 10 am when the Discovery Mall opens.

Bali have many beach, Kuta beach is one of beaches in Bali. Not good for relax and swim for kids. The wave very high, but still okay for surf.

Just a simple warning to anyone who is new to Bali.
Becarefull when buying groceries at places like minimarts. Always count how much it really cost as people at the counter will try to rip you off, because not everyone check how much change they were given.
A girl in front of us got roped off for 100000 rupiah.

Since my travel buddy loves to watch the sun set, we did not miss out on the opportunity to watch the Balinese sunset. I'm not usually a 'sun set' person but because we were to watch it at the beach then I was all in to watch it. It was also romantic watching it with someone special. I found Kuta Beach to be a nice place, it has the ff things:
1. fine white sand
2. vendors who sell drinks from alcoholic to bottled water
3. safety signs that you are only to swim in certain areas since this is a place where surfers go

If you don't surf or swim, you can watch the sun set here while people watching as well.

It's sad though that the place was a bit littered but it's not like a dump. I guess I just had my focus on the sun set and not the random litter. It's a public beach so you can't expect it to be like how resorts maintain their beach front.

So sad how the beach is littered with waste of all descriptions. There were lots of people trying to clean it up-sad thing is that it shouldn't be there anyway. Perhaps locals and tourists alike need to take more responsibility with recycling. No way would I walk on the beach without shoes. I saw the occasional syringe!

The beach is really dirty... I don't even want to know what's swimming in the water... its enough to see the beach... The locals are trying to sell you stuff on the beach...annoying. .. A lot nicer beaches in bali where nobody is hassling you!

Well - I guess if your going to be in Bali, a trip to the "legendary" Kuta Beach is mandatory. Unfortunately for most Australians, we are very spoilt when it comes to quality beaches.
Kuta Beach is special, the sand is dark, there were tonnes of rubbish strewn over it, hawkers will try and sell you anything from crossbows to leather bangles - yet it still delights.
My son learnt to surf, we got a bit sunburnt, the mountains in the background make the seascape look awesome, people were very polite and respectful.
It's not the best beach in Bali by far, but it's Kuta, and we love it as much as the rest of the beautiful island of Bali.

Kuta beach has lots to see and do. You can go for walk from Kuta to Seminyak if you want, learn to surf, play volleyball or soccer with the locals or just grab a deck chair and chill out for the day. There are people flying kites and there are so many people from all over the world

It's a very clean beach. Saw a tractor with sweater when I took an early walk along the beach one morning. You can get cheap surf lessons. The instructors stay in the water with you. Take a miss on the massages you can get them just as cheap in the spas. Waters warm :-)

I visited what is supposed to be a better part of town in Seminyak and despite what people say this is not much better than Kuta. It is dirty, trash everywhere, smelly, and overcrowded with people and motorbikes. I also visited Kuta and it was just as bad. The beaches are ok, but filled with trash and many annoying hawkers. They just keep bothering you non-stop. "Hey" "massas?" "motorbike?" "pedicure?" "surf?" "umbrella?" "hey" "hey" "hey" "hey" "where are you going?"And the list goes on and on!!! They never stop! Even when you just plain ignore them. The place is swarmed by scooters that even ride the sidewalks and don't give a damn about anybody. In 3 days I was there, I saw at least 2 scooters go down. They honk at everything that moves and doesn't. I am not exaggerating. Finally, the place it overfilled with tourists, trashy expats, and wanna be models. Lots of trash! Yeah, sunsets are beautiful, but sunsets are beautiful everywhere else. Unless you are into anything I just talked about, I would take Bali off my list.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,488,40>===============  
Best time to visit is an hour or so before sunset. Grab a chair at one of the many bars along the beach and have a cold ale whilst waiting for sunset time. Great to see so many local family groups at this time on the beach. Buy all manner of things from the local sellers on the beach. Have a manicure, pedicure or leg massage into the bargain for amazing prices.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,488,30>===============  
Many places along the beach have bean bags and outdoor restaurants to enjoy the sunset. In the daytime the beach is the dirtiest I have ever seen. A lot of garbage gets washed up there. Not recommended for swimming!! The Gili islands have the nicest beaches in Bali and crystal clear water!

Visit only if you are a surfer. This beach has amazing waves ideal for surfing otherwise it is full of stones and pebbles which makes life difficult for casual travellers. It is also the most famous beach of Bali hence a bit crowded
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,489,20>===============  
Can be a good surf here but beware of surfboards when swimming between the flags. The life guards don't seem to care ,and even the surf schools take their learners between the flags That are supposed to be for swimming only Some lifeguards do control the boards but the beach near benasari is the worst.

Having stayed st the Dynasty Hotel in Tuban, we were in walking distance to most of the things we like to do. Waterbom Park just down the road. Pathway at back of our hotel so we could walk along the beach to Kuta every morning. So relaxing. Centro, Lippo Mall and Matahari were all within walking distance and our favourite shopping venues. Massage and nail facilities everywhere you walk, great for a late night massage when walking back to hotel after dinner. The Dynasty is located in Tuban in a street that contains many family hotels and feels much safer than parts of Kuta where all the nightclubs etc are. So many great places to eat, just depends what you like. Some of our favourite restaurants this trip were
Il Tempio (Italian) near Bali Garden Hotel. Such great service and food. A wonderful violinist plays electric violin on a Friday night, both modern, pop and classical type music. Nice change from usual types of entertainment in Bali. Reasonably priced and great decor. We also like the Thai restaurant across the road from the Dynasty, next to an italian restaurant. Damask past centro heading onto Kuta also has a great menu. Febris good for a casual lunch or dinner and cheap. We also ate at Pappas in Kuta across from beach. Kopi Pot in Legian and Beachwalk Cafe Tuban. Bali Biku was also a wonderful experience in seminyak with the high tea. However did not like Seminyak , shopping so expensive, did not seem as friendly up that way. So many good places to eat in Tuban and Kuta, so don't just stay in your hotel. That can get very boring and expensive.

I would never base myself in Kuta when in Bali and never have, but the beach is full if pleasant surprises if you first lower your expectations before coming here.

Neither pristine nor glamorous, Kuta beach has its pluses. The lifesavers are lovely boys, so happy and interactive. The visitors bring a cosmopolitan feel, being a mix from all over the globe. the run down backdrop has character and atmosphere.

This is a great place to just come to for a half day when in Bali, just to check out. Not a tropical paradise by any means, but a must see, must do nevertheless.

The young guys on the beach are very friendly and helpful in their knowledge of where to surf/swim. The only negative was I couldn't just sit there in the shade watching my man and son surf without all the women coming up to me selling trinkets and massages constantly. Even after buying a few bracelets wasn't enough, always wanting me to buy more. Got annoying to the point of me having to be rude, and Im not that kind of person. Put me off going down there.

Kuta beach is what it is - yes full of hawkers but within walking distance and we were looked after so well by Wyan who owned the loungers we hired and Beres, Baileys & Sam at the bar. Water was nice and such an interesting people watching place. Great sunsets too.

If you are not surfing there are better beaches to go to around Bali... Don't stay there for to long as the sea is not calm and the beach itself can be quit annoying with all the dudes trying to sell you stuff or to make you to rent a surf board or to talk a lesson. If you are a beginner surfer though, this spot is great for starting your surfing experience in Bali!

I have been to many, many beaches all over the world and Kuta beach has been the dirtiest by far. Had I known how much garbage could accumulate here during the rainy season, I never would have booked any time here! The reason we chose to stay in Kuta was so that my husband could do some surfing but after only 15 minutes in the water, he got out and told me about all the garbage floating around in the surf - plastic bags, bottles and even condoms. Truly disgusting!
Needless to say, we spent the rest of our time by our hotel pool.

First off, I disagree with people stating that this beach is filthy. You have probably not seen Tanjong Beach yet. We enjoyed this beach a lot. Not that it is a clear beach. But you'll have a fun time here. We went here at around 10pm and stayed here for 1am. Though it's too dark, you'll still enjoy the eerie sound of the waves.

This beach is really disgusting. There was rubbish everywhere washed up on the sand, not to mention the dead fish and dog excretement. I went for a walk along the sand and was bitten by a bali dog which ran up from behind me, which caused one of the locals to start laughing...nice!

On another occasion I sat down to have a massage by one of the beach ladies and for nearly the entire hour I was harassed constantly by other vendors. I ended up being quite rude at them because telling them politely 'no thank you' 10 times just isn't obvious enough.

Never will I return to Bali......

Kuta Beach is a great mix of random chaos mixed with relentless Beach sellers, cheap tattoos and some great surf.
Now it is not a pristine Beach OK. If you want that go to another Beach. It is though huge fun! And if you have ever wanted to learn to surf if had some The friendliest small shore breaks in the world. The combination of the great little waves and a giant foam board means that if you try you will surf. If you need help get a lesson. Don't pay more than $5 for a board for 2 hours.

Be prepared - there is a lot of rubbish but they are trying to clean it up.

I was staying in central Kuta so I decided to walk all the way to Jalan Legian and then to Pantai Kuta. The gate to the beach is already an arquitectonic masterpiece.

A local advised it is bein washed in from another island with the tide, but they still had piles of rubbish a meter high along the beaches so I cant imagine it's not all from elsewhere...

Kuta beach is good for a visit on a sunny day to enjoy the fresh cool breeze.
It is safe but as in other public areas just be weary of leaving your stuff unattended.
Don't mind the hagglers just say no thanks and avoid eye contact or they'll keep at it.
The only problem is it is dirty down by the shoreline so not a place to swim.

Bali was our honeymoon destination with amazing beaches , the sunset and wow the rain with a unbelievable nature.We were here for a 5 days trip and happen to cover up all the tourist destinations in Bali with the relaxing massages.Don't miss out on the Kuta beach.We are really thankful to the amazing bali crowd very down to earth and helpful people.We were lucky enough to meet the taxi driver who was soooooo helpful and made our journey worth.

Tip - Don't give a second thought if planning to visit Bali just go :)

If planning for a visit to Bali you can get in touch with this taxi service guy he was very helpful and reasonable charges per day. (you can use our name to get a reasonable price :)

If its Bali, its Kuta. I maybe biased but its Kuta that draws me to Bali. I dont quite fancy solitude and quiet places when am in Bali.
Kuta never disappoints in terms of life and the crowd and its happening events.
Its not quiet which i like and the atmosphere is probably the best in SE Asia
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,494,50>===============  
We had Kuta as base for our trip throughout Indonesia. We love Kuta beach, been there for several years and were there almost everyday when we were on Bali. We always hire sunbeds and order drinks it is very relaxing because there are not a lot of tourist on the beach, i think they might prefer to stay in their resorts.
I see a lot of complaints about the people who sell their merchandise on Kuta Beach. I really don't get that because to me that's the charm of being on the beach in an asian country, it's like a passing market. When you don't want to buy something just say "No thank you" in a very friendly way and they will leave you alone. Keep in mind that this is their source of income, be respectful and they will be the same with you, there's no use in being rude because remember you are a guest in their country...

About massage, mani/pedi and buying necklaces etc.;
There are a lot of women who come to you to offer this. I have my preference for just a few because there are a lot of them who don't do it right.

For massage;
Putu #10 is the best of the best, she gives you a GREAT massage for at least an hour and she is a very friendly, honest person.
DON'T go to Juliana and Annie and their family because they are a rip off and call their whole family so then you'll have 5 family members surrounding you and touching you without your permission. My husband missed quite an amount of money out of his pocket after they surrounded us and did his nails, we cannot say who took it out of his pocket but at least one of them did, so we decided never to do any business with them anymore which i also told them.

For mani/pedi:
Tini is the best there is, honest, very precise with a heart of gold. This woman takes the time and has a great spirit! She also braids hair.
DON'T go with Nikki cause she's also a family member of the above. There is also a Nikki who sells dresses please don't mix her up with Nikki for the nails because Nikki of the dresses is a very kind woman.

For bracelets and necklaces:
Go with Jenny, she is also very honest and sweet and if you want a specific thing she will make sure to get it for you. Her husband does the temporary tattoos also a very kind man.

Surflessons;
Go to Ramon and Dion, 2 great guys originally from Sumatra who speak perfectly english and Dion speaks very good Dutch and loves to learn more.

Fruit;
Go with Ketut, we always order fruit from her. The other day i ordered a mango and while she was cutting it she said the mango was no good so she cut another one. Well, that says enough.

Overall Kuta Beach is a great beach to relax and enjoy one of the most beautiful sunsets you have ever seen. We always layed on the sunbeds in front of the Sheraton hotel, enjoy!

The beach itself is ok, however a lot of litter gets washed which sometimes gets left for a long time, but I've seen a couple locals trying to clean their area up. The surf is good when it's offshore, not so much onshore as it's very white (and not brilliant for swimming). There are locals selling drinks all the way down to legion beach and they all hire out boards as well! :) however, whilst staying very close to this beach, on 29th January the officials did a 'beach clean up' and brutally murdered dogs all over Kuta beach. Has put me right off Kuta beach!

Kuta was probably lovely once. That day is long past. The reviews here largely capture what it has become. The beach itself is not the lovely white sand of other bits of Bali - it is volcanic sand. The water isn't bad, waves good for surfing, but the accumulated plastic garbage on the beach is really a turnoff - my short survey found it made up largely of yogurt cups, bags, cutlery, and drink bottles. The country has to get serious about changing the 'throw it in the river' practices that are causing this.

Off the beach, the main streets are now over-developed, in an under-controlled manner, and not worth the visit.... unless you like that sort of thing. There are lots of bars, trinkets shops, cheapo restaurants, massage places, and an unending supply of vendors of tour services, the trinkets and whatever. I gave it 2 stars because some people might, as mentioned, like this sort of stuff. I don't.

Wonderful place to kick back with a Bintang and watch the sunset. I have been lucky enough to see a green flash on a number of occasions. During the rainy season it can get fairly gross with tbe plastic but the locals try to clean it up as fast as they can. Terrific during the dry season with the offshore winds Good surfing but can get crowded with the schools. You can get massages, sarongs, temporary tattoos, and souvenirs there too.

I was make a visit to Bali more than 5 times .. Entire place more n more become dirty island , everything is expensive , some driver is bad .. Most of the time Try cheating tourist (luckily I went many many time before) ..

1)Kuta - dirty , expensive , scamming surround the night life area

2)Water sport at tanjung benoa - VERY expensive , clouded area , dangerous place to play on .

3) Tanah lot - now become too commercial area n very very clouded of tourist

4) Ubud - medium size village full of private transport (van,jeep,MPV).. Too many hotel .. , road is small .

5) uluwatu .. - now a day consider very very clouded area . (Full day tour price around $400 - $500 rupiah, transport base from Kuta town . Place to visit : batik factory , some temple surrounding depensar, sanur, water sports at tanjung benoa , hotel at nusa dua , Bali collection center , dreamland beach , jimbaran sea side diner )

6) kintamani (valcano hill view) - nothing much area to visit , surrounding restaurant buffer taste is BAD . And the coffee farm at surrounding area price very expensive , cheating tourist on "luwak coffee" ..n taste was not good, selling expensive (Full day tour price $700k - $900k rupiah , transport base from Kuta town : place to visit - tagallelang rice field , kintamani valcano hill view , coffee agrofarm , silver shop + factory )

7) Bedegul ( lake side temple - ulun danu ) - good to visit , but very far away from Kuta town ( full day tour price around $700- 900k from Kuta town : place to visit included - lake temple at ulun danu beratan, jetiluwih rice field <road condition was bad n small >, ayun temple (holy temple) , mongkey forest , & Tanah lot )

8) jimbaran - worst place for diner , 99% restaurant Was cheating tourist (driver getting very high commission ) food taste really bad .

General review :
1) full day transport < 8.30am till 7pm +/- >: $500k - $900kmax rupiah <try not to use hourly charges >
2) Kuta town to airport : good to use blue taxi with meter .. From beach walk shopping / hard rock to airport cost around $60k rupiah
3) airport to center Ubud : cost around $250 -$300k rupiah < cost base on private van /MPV / avanza >
4) all cost base on each car , small MPV (Suzuki) or Toyota avanza .. Not base on per person
5) most of the TOURIST restaurant are expensive

Forget Bali .. N start look into Vietnam , Philippine (boracay n some other place , Cambodia ,

We like most people have a favourite bar on the beach and the barman have been looking after us for about 8 years now. I was very disappointed with the amount of debris washed up on the beach and the huge smelly pile left at the beach that we walked by every day. The beach workers all pitch in to clean the beaches but it seems to be a losing battle with nature.

The beach was overcrowded during this time of the year, with locals as well as tourists. Hundreds upon hundreds of people don't really make for a good time at the beach.

I tried surfing at the beach (was charged about 20 USD for an hour lesson and two hours on the board), however there were also too many surfers in the water which made it more difficult. The waves were okay and doable for beginners (ie not too strong/heavy/fast) around the early afternoon. Seminyak beach has much lesser people and also has the same attractions around the beach (plus bars/cafes where you can chill)
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,496,40>===============  
Its certainly not the best beach in the world & I was actually alittle disappointed at first, but it is a good place to spend time particularly to the see the sunset. Spent alot of time walking along the beach, drinking, eating, had a surf lesson, played beach football & just be amazed in the local crafts being sold. Yes they can be abit clingy if you express any interest at all, but we had to admire the hand crafted bow & arrow set one guy was touting to us, how he thought we would get that through customs I have no idea, but a continious polite response of "tidak terima kasih" saw him off.

Smart has done a great job in upgrading the ever present massage - foot reflexology, Balinese full massage - all honest and no hanky panky here. If you are a guy and want real want tough real feel massage - ask for Azwar or Wira - both extremely experienced. All services up to world class and do remember these staff just like in the USA depend on tips - so all of you please be generous.

Have been several times and will be here again in few months.

We stayed at the Kuta Beach 4 days and we were really sad and disappointed about the trash! It's no fun go swimming. Every 2 seconds you have plastic trash arround your feet and legs in the water. Never seen such a dirty water and beach before. We've seen people removing some trash at the beginning of the water, but there has to be done much more than this.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,496,20>===============  
Apart from the fact that surfing can be done here, it is the worst beach ever. The beach is flooded with plastic, bottles, bags, leaves, paper, garbage, all kinds of litter. The sand is no good, there is no restaurant nearby on the beach. The Sanur beach is much cleaner. You should visit Sanur beach, but not Kuta beach. While surfing the garbage sticks to your face and body.

While the road leading to the beach is great for cheap buys and good restaurants, the beach itself is just so-so. There's litters here and there.

The beach is also crowded all day long- so not suitable is you are looking for a quiet, laid back time..

Kuta Beach has been blessed with a nice beach and great waves for surfing, but the beach itself, is full of trash. Plastic, cups, bags and more. Even in the ocean you will encounter more trash than fish. It seems like there is no real effort from the local community being done, to keep the beach clean. Instead take your time to walk the 30 minutes north towards the Semniyak beach, which for some parts, especially outside the large hotels, are nice and clean. Also in that area, there are locals that sweeps the sand for trash, and actually do a pretty good job keeping the beach in good condition. Of course it is only my oppinion, but I did spend a month there.... and it was not a onetime misfortune.

This beach has seen its day as a great beach experience. The minute your feet hit the sand its money, money, money. I got quite sick of it. Don't sit in the chairs unless you pay for a drink or you get a scolding. The neverending row of cabana's at 50K an hour and endless hassling for jewellery, ice creams, carvings, henna tattoos, body board, surfboard, massage, pedicure. I could go on and on. Barely any of the surf instructors have qualifications or qualified experience to teach you to surf. I know this because I am a surfer with a long association with the International Surfing Association coaching and judging accreditation. At $10 an hour ($5 for the board and $5 for the 'coach') you'd be better paying the $20 for 2 hours at the accredited surf schools. The beach is so dirty and the water full of rubbish. Hated it. Saving grace is the sunset with young people playing soccer and volleyball and the great friendly atmosphere.

When on the beach be prepared to be swarmed by people selling stuff!

beautiful beaches but can be dangerous for inexperienced swimmers and surfers, there is a heavy current which can pull you to open sea, I watcedh a tourist almost drowning because of the slow response of beachguards.
wear slippers the hot sand can burn your feet easily, best time for a swim is morning and evening sunset.
bali food is cheaply available at the beaches and delicious.

Went for a walk most mornings while I stayed near the beach for 7 nights. In the morning all the trash rolls in. Then the beach cleaners come and clean it up by hand the best they can. You must go for a walk along there at some point while in Bali. I wouldn't swim in the water but people do. It is also nice to pick a bar along the beach and have a drink while the sunsets. The beach on the other side, Nusa Dua is cleaner and better.

As the saying goes, Timing is everything... If you want to relax and enjoy some peace and quiet, go early in the morning and watch the sun rise. You'll share the beach with only a few people.

Throughout the day the beach is a busy place, with people trying to sell you everything from a seat to sit on, a cold drink or a sarong.

The beach itself is ok, not as pretty as Dreamland but accessible and close to most hotels in the area. When I was there, there was lots of rubbish washed up on the shore and while people were cleaning it up, they were just leaving it in big piles on the beach... so, it was still not attractive.

My tip would be to pull up a seat and order your favourite cold drink at sunset. Sit back and enjoy the beauty of the sun setting behind the waves (and don't forget your camera)!

Kuta beach got a clean up after New years day. The streets in Denpasser is dirty, with some residence urinating on the side walks. Hawkers hassle you all the time. Prices can easily be negotiated for items but they are gonna remember you and you will be swamped by hawkers.

Be careful of cheats. Do NOT go to MONEY CHANGERS. They will cheat you!! Use the atm's to draw money- you will safe on the long run.

Blue Bird taxis: DO NOT USE THEM- they will cost you on average 4x more than an un-metered taxi. Google your destination before hand- then you can negotiate a price.

DiveDiveDive Bali: Scuba diving: excellent service and professional operator. They will pick you up at your hotel.

POD chocolate: A place to definitely see and experience.

I'm so disappointed on what Kuta Beach has become. It used to be a nice place to relax...tan...and read a book. Now..its full of 'bali cowboys', surf shops, persistent locals selling stuff that you don't want, and..especially on the weekends...thousands of locals...fully clothed... just standing around and over-crowding the beach. It's no longer a place that to go anymore. It's noisy and dirty now. I definitely do not recommend it. Just go..see...and leave. There are many more nice beaches around Bali to go to. Not this one.

Rather than looked at the sea, I watched thousand of people along the beach for the sunset. But, the place was not really bad. Pretty cool though. For any massage freaks, there were many massaseurs that offer cheap services at the beach.

Kuta beach had literally mountains of garbage all along it until Seminyak. It made swimming and walking impossible and totally disgusting. The beach would be such an asset to Bali, keep it clean!

During my third trip to Indonesia I was there in September 2014, and I Just have to confirm my first impression: this beach is really nothing special.
It is good for surfing, at least for beginners - that was why I was there: cheap boards everywhere, and easy waves with low tide.
But that's it: it is crowded, the water is not crystal clear, and Kuta, the big party town, is just there, almost on the beach.
If you are there for crazy party nights, or to practice beginners surfing before going for the real thing, well, ok, but if you're looking for your own slice of tropical paradise, with so many incredible islands and beaches around Indonesia you better look somewhere else.

I was very waiting for our trip to Bali to the kuta beach as Bali has a very good reputation and my friend has already been here 15 years ago and then it was clean and beautiful but this time it was a big disappointment. I can find no words to express how dirty the water and the beach is. Full of plastic bags. I could make no step in the water without hanging another plastic item on my foot. Disgusting. And it seems that no one tries to clean it. There is a few dust heaps on the beach but you will see them on the following days, too. (The rest are not in the heaps) Maybe it is only at winter but I will not try it again neither in summer.

We found that Kuta Beach was nicer than Double Six and Legian Beach as the sand was yellow-white rather than brown and there were less seats covering the area. There were surfers in the water though so that would be a downfall for people who aren't surfing and wish to swim.

The beach, we were told, is lovely between April and September - just our luck to go there in December!! It's a long beach, a bay in fact. Surfing and safe swimming. Beer available on the sands. Not far from Beachwalk and the Sheraton hotel (at one end), with a shopping centre for when it rains.

So long as it is not in the rainy season, it's a great beach! The walking vendors are quite courteous, accepting a simple "No Thanks." and the same for the guys with drinks and chaises for rent.
I have heard that when it is really in the rainy season, the ocean brings in to the beaches a LOT of floating plastic
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,500,30>===============  
The good: A beautiful stretch of beach. A great walkway to meander along. Always lots happening - surf lessons, vendors who sell services such as manicures, massages etc or food and drinks (and give you plastic chairs to sit on while you drink them). Everything is very cheap, ie AUS $2.00 for whole fresh coconut, $2.50 for Bintang beer, $4.50 for plate of babi guling.
The bad: The vendors will approach you repeatedly. Lots of foreigners behaving badly.
The ugly: Over the course of four days we saw a great deal of rubbish floating in the sea.
Overall, glad we saw it and would recommend it for the experience but would not recommend swimming in the sea there.

I would say you aren't missing much if you skip kuta beach

Pro's: good waves for beginner surfing and you can get a board and an hour lesson for only 150k Rp, cheap beer, water itself is clean (less the garbage floating around) and warm

Welcome to Kuta beach. The most famous beach on the Bali island. A place for those of you, who want to enjoy the sunset. Hard Rock Cafe and Beachwalk located along this beach. If you hard to find park, you can park your car on Beachwalk.

We visit this beach only once and to tell the truth it doesn't worth to visit more than once. It is ok to see the sunset from here but we see better sunsets in better areas like Suluban Beach and Tanah Lot.
The beach is very big but overcrowded, noisy and unfortunately very dirty. Also the sea didn't look so attractive and apart from this you would not be so sure to leave your staff and go to swim.
It is full also from small so called beach bars and retailers that try to sell you everything.
Our opinion is to try other beaches around the island.

Visited in May 2014. I would recommend visiting the beach, even if it is just to see the beautiful sunset.
There are lots of restaurants on the front but they're very expensive. Sit on the beach for free and watch the sunset, then head to one of the backstreets - there are plenty of more affordable restaurants.

If you are into surfing then this beach will be great for you however other holiday goers who just want to relax and swim not so, when we went the sand was dirty and so much rubbish everywhere and people selling things everywhere, the water itself was warm however all the rubbish swimming next to you in the ocean is pretty off putting too. It was fun to hang in and get hit by all the waves but I wouldn't go there to relax id go elsewhere like Nusa Dua

Kuta is not somewhere i would recommend. I came here wanting to see for my self what the hype was all about and i seriously couldn't find anything that would attract me back to Kuta.

I loved kuta beach, as many tourists may not, but I enjoyed my time sitting with a bingtang, admiring the amazing sunset while listening to the beach boys singing at party bar, think called. Then having the sellers trying to sell you their items its the best experience.

the things I disliked about Kuta beach was: The massage ladies can get annoying at times, trying to touch you while your sitting there watching the sunset. But you just "no" and they should get the picture of you not wanting that.

Advice can give:
- Go listen to the beach boys sing, such a memorable moment in my life.
- Don't let the sellers, massage people and manicure people annoy you.
- Best massagers are: Yupi
- Best manicures are: Mumma Loco

This beach looks like a garbage dump. I believe all the trash swirling around in the ocean will eventually find its way here to Kuta Beach.

One of the locals said it only happens in the winter months with the tides. Ha ha ha. I doubt that. I'm pretty sure it has to be dirty all year round. And there are a bunch of people trying to surf in the waters off Kuta Beach. Yuck.

Seriously, how many times have you read a review that said the beach was filthy? This beach was NOT a reason to head to this area. And the traffic around the beach area is congested and awful.

How do people go running along the beach with the smell of exhaust from the cars stuck in all that traffic?

Every time we go to Bali we visit Kuta Beach. Always buzzing with action. Loads of kids playing - including local kids playing soccer against each other. Cold Bintang always available.

The beach is not clean due to over crowded tourists. although it is cleaned everyday in the morning to the cleanest, gets dirty immiediately due to the crowd. Good for surfing as water is not dirty. and plenty of stay options are available nearby.

Kuta beach is certainly not the best although a good place to watch the sunset. I live in Australia which has the best beaches so Kuta beach does not compare at all.

I took a sunset stroll along Kuta Beach. It was a beautiful sunset, but marred by all the trash along the shore. There's a lot of rubbish everywhere! I think it's an opportunity to provide some jobs to keep the place clean. I noticed a lot of hagglers offering hair braiding, bracelets, etc. I didn't get hassled much since I look Indonesian (but am not). They can get quite pushy, and then they might get verbally aggressive. Best to just keep walking ahead and ignore them. At night some of the paths aren't lit well or not at all, so walking back by myself to the hotel was a little gnarly, but I got there safely. Just keep your wits about you and you'll be okay :) There's quite a few bars/restaurants along the beach to chill with a Bintang, and enjoy the random fireworks that happen now and then.

Shame on Indonesia - shame on Bali. Litter and garbage is everywhere. The Kuta beach - so truly beautiful on the Indian ocean was like hanging out in a garbage dump. You literally walked on plastic and other garbage to enter the surf and it was strewn across the beach in layers.

If they made a movie about Bali it would be called EAT, PAY, LEAVE.

Traffic is horrendous. It touch nearly 2.5 hours to travel about 15 km. I could have walked faster.

I cant recommend this island for any tourists who value any infrastructure (safe water, a sewage system, roads, etc)

This once beautiful island still has potential - but the people and the country need to start to take care of it.

Avoid No Lightings after sunset. The beach road is shady without street lights and you might feel unsafe after 10 p.m. You will regret booking a hotel at this beach

However, be worn there are a lot of scammers and hustlers on and near the beach. They harass you until you become rude. You really can't relax on the beach much, hence why I stayed at my hotel pool to relax and ventured out for a little shopping and restaurants. Make sure you understand the currentcy etc. but bargain/barter for everything. You can get some great buys and a lot for your money too. Other than the constant harassment by salesmen I enjoyed my time in Bali. Would recommend it for holiday makers wanting to just relax and get cheap spa treatments and clothing.

It's a nice beach, but it was trashed when we were there. We tried to go swimming but there were plastic bags and all kinds of garbage constantly hitting us. (I was hoping it was just seaweed but turned out it was trash.) I'd recommend some of the other beaches, or maybe this beach if part of it were cleaned up by a hotel or something.

Right from the time the plane touches the scenic island till one departs --- you carry excellent memories of a laid back peaceful holiday right from a variety of hotels to stay with excellent hospitality and of course the most important link , ie the TAXI DRIVER who have the right aptitude to conduct a tourist and hence his selection itself is the most important step and any past references of the taxi driver definitely gives you a lead for a comfortable and enjoyable stay.
From the airport the rising terrain gives you a proper feel of not only the beaches but takes to the midlands of UBUD laid out with lush green paddy fields and beyond that meandering through the hills and forests takes you to the unbelievable misty and foggy hills with BEDUGUL TEMPLE AND LAKE being the greatest attraction and a must see place.
Temples ; nicely constructed and decorated at every nook and corner add to the religious sentiments of the locals. For a short stay Kuta Beach area is the best ; but for longer stay upto 4 -5 days venturing out to other places is worth it !!!!

Great place! I had loads of fun, I bought loads of things to. There are so many people trying to sell you stuff, like getting your hair braided or nails painted or buying hats, sarongs, t shirts, towels or other random things like that. Not only that but the beach is great for a long summers walk. I do recommend not being bare foot on the sand. I nearly deep fried my feet. This is a great place with many fancy restaurants. If you don't want to spend tons of money on a beer don't say no to stopping at a drink stall.

So many scams so many rip offs its dirty and not relaxing at all.. From the moment you step off the plane someone is having a try at swindling you, in the airport they done even give you the correct change for your entry extortion, money changers are super dishonest.. As at today I changed only 1 million idr and the "authorised" money changer tried to short change me 50% .. The entire holiday we have had to put up with this rubbish.. In short I wouldn't even send my enemies here.. Avoid at all cost if you want to relax

Bali is beautiful. So busy you need to stop to take it in sometimes. The beach is nice...good for surfing...aside from the just too much garbage everywhere. Even when swimming you get bags and what I'm sure was a diaper wrapped around your ankles...cans and bottles...not pleasurable for swimming at all.

We enjoyed staying near this beach. Check out the sunsets over the sea.
We docked at the harbour on our cruise and was taken by taxi with Darma Putranas our driver. Telephone number +6281805516798. Took us to Ubud for the day from the cruise ship dock near Nusa Dua and then to our hotel inBali. Next morning arrived on time to take us to the airport for our flight to Hong Kong. I can heartily recommend his services.

My cousins and I wanted to walk over from our villa to enjoy the sunset. but the moment we sat down about 7 different people came and crowded around us trying to sell services or goods. its was incredibly annoying. we understand that they have to make money but they just cannot take no for an answer and they won't leave you alone.
so just be mindful and try to go near the water and away from everyone.

honestly balinese people are very gentle and kind. we've met loads of sweet people. but when they try to sell you things it can get a bit frustrating.

Considering I went to Lombok and Gili Air and Bali on my 2 week vacation, I'd give Bali 3.5 stars. It was nice, but compared to Lombok and Gili Air, not even close to the same. The beaches weren't as nice and just too many people. Food was more expensive and just too crowded over all. Still a nice place to visit, but I would recommend Gili Air for sure, especially if you love snorkeling and private quiet beaches.

We headed to Kuta specifically to witness the iconic sunset everybody talks about. Being so popular, the beach will be crowded. It was worth the wait, and relaxing despite not taking a dip in the sea. There are plenty of local vendors around to serve you a nice cold beer or local snack.

If you plan on arriving close to the sunset, be sure to anticipate a very heavy traffic jam when you enter Kuta!

Kuta was awesome albiet a second home for Australians, but I would recommend to anyone.

I just wanted to warn everyone to STAY AWAY from a certain little inlet of market shops in Kuta. It's located on the corner of Jl. Pantai Kuta and Jl. Raya Kuta. Next to the gelati shop, and there was a sign above/near it saying Hidden Oasis B&B

My boyfriend and I were looking through different market stalls when (as they always do) the male shopkeeps ushered us into their shop. We walked through a small alleyway of shopkeeps into smaller opening of different (but selling all the same things) market stalls. The shopkeep showed us different clothes, pushing us on buying them (which they all do), but when we said we were fine and didn't want anything, the male became increasingly aggressive, pretending to throw a 6 pack of stubby coolers at our faces and then threw a can on the floor directly in front of us.
As we were walking out, another shopkeep KICKED the back of my boyfriends leg and then whacked him with a coat hanger.
He shrugged it off just saying "woah aggressive" and the shopkeepers started mocking him.

Just wanted to warn everyone else, as it was not a pleasant experience.

Kuta beach is the touristy heart of Bali. It is very crowded with too many hawkers trying to sell you things The beach is very sad, Stay out of the water as you may choke on a piece of garbage floating around. The authorities need to clean the beach on a daily basis and install a lot of dustbins around as the trash invariably lands up in the water and there is a lot of rubbish floating around in the water like plastics bags, plastic bottles and all sorts of things, The area around is also dirty. I guess this is to be expected as this is a public beach.

The beach is Full of deck chairs and people wanting to rent out surfboards.

If you want peace and quiet then this is not the place to come..

We went to Kuta Beach in September / October and were really surprised as we expected some kind of crowded, touristy and party-type of beach: It was nearly nothing like that in low season.

There were some nice little bars with plastic chairs and eskies selling big Bintang for 20.000 to 25.000 IR (We loved Pande's Bar!), yummy little warungs selling soup and Nasi Campur for little money. There were some tourists, some people selling bracelets and souvenirs but not as much as we expected. People were really friendly... the beach was not crowded at all.

We had some surf lessons with some Indonesian guys at the beach. They were friendly, nice, know what they do and explain well, even though their English is not so good, but they try!

We enjoyed our days at Kuta Beach just relaxing and lying at the beach, drinking beer and watching the sunset. Seems like in low season you can have a good time here even when you are not looking for party all day long.

The Aussie surfers who found out Kuta Beach many years ago may never fathomed that one day, it's going to become the Kuta Beach that it is today. Apartments, shopping centres are sprouting everywhere...yes, they are STILL sprouting. Some real estate in Bali is even more expensive than in Singapore?! Yes, there are a lot of opportunists everywhere but they are relatively gentle. When they know that you are not interested, they would move on to the next target. I don't find them threatening at all. You also have a lot of local surfer dudes who are out there renting out gears to the overseas people such as surfboards, waterboard. Some people simply sit on the beach watching the world goes by, taking their dogs out for a walk, or simply reading a nice book. In terms of finding the "REAL" Bali, you may have to wander deeper inland. As for now, I think the beaches are claimed by Westerners in particular long time ago. There are club lounges by the beach and as the sun sets, the music beat starts turning up. Whether you like it or not, I think it is still worth your while to visit how Bali became a household name at the first place and it began with a "K" and Kuta is the name!!

Kuta Beach is the major tourist attraction in Bali. It is located close to Denpasar airport and is enclosed by a wall with several gates in the traditional Balinese style. Beyond the wall is a road and across the road are many premium hotels and shopping malls.

The beach is semi-circular and pretty long. It is very clean and beautiful and is an ideal location for watersports. It is not too crowded. There are many vendors renting surfboards and other equipment at reasonable rates. Food and snacks are also available.

It is close to the legian entertainment area and shopping areas of Bali and is best for a relaxing afternoon or evening.

A must see attraction in Bali.

During daytime it's mostly too hot to stay at the beach, without any shades - but in the afternoon the waves are still ok and it's a nice place to spend some ours. You can take a surf lesson or just rent a surfboard for not more than 5USD per hour.

This is FREE!! Get yourself down to the beach around 5 pm and watch how everything calms down. Brings some nuts or Pringles if that is your thing and grab a beer, iced tea or coke from one of the many drink stalls. The stall operators will provide you with a table and a stubby cooler if you drink as slowly as me:-) the balinese will come and talk to you and there hunger for business has pretty much waned by now. Have a late afternoon swim if you want but then sit down on a seat that they will provide, an umbrella too if you desire and watch the magnificent sunsets. If you are sporty the Balinese will always welcome you into a game of soccer but remember( hello argentina and Europe espepcially) that there are no egos amongst the Balinese they are there for exercise and fun and IF you tackle them too hard and injure them then they may NOT be able to feed their families.NB! Just relax and enjoy. If you are staying till it gets dark remember the insect repellent.there are not many but don't risk it. Enjoy it's FREE!

This is an expansive, deep beach with a beautiful wide-open view of the water. Great roller for some surfing (not huge when I was there). There are no islands to view from the beach so you're pretty much looking out to the horizon. GORGEOUS sunsets. However, I found the water to be unsanitary and polluted. Being from Miami I chose not to enter the water because of this. Just too much trash floating around for me. I assume this is because it's one of the more popular/congested beach in the region. There are lots of hawkers on the beach trying to give you massages, cold drinks, etc. You just have to make it past them and then they aren't really a nuisance. Plus, if you want a cold Bintang you don't have to go far!

Kuta Beach has all the workings of a lovely spot but it's marred by persistent peddlers. While I understand they are only making a living, I just find their persistence very annoying.

Very crowded and busy area, too many hawkers trying to sell you things. shopping is pricey compared to Tanah lot and most of the store owners will try and rip you off.

Much has been said about Kuta, more negative than positive. I had a good time despite the crowds, people insisting on selling you things, etc. but found a great warung and a great guest house and that made my visit worth it, definitely not the best welcome to Bali, my advise, go out and explore it

This is the best beach for me in Bali. You can play, learn or just watch people surfing or body boarding. A lot of residence bring their pets to play in beach too. You can have your hair braided, get temporary tattoing, or get message. Or you can just lay fdown & get sun tan.

I never like swimming at Kuta, there's always rubbish in the water, plastics, floaties, all sorts of things.

This hotel is located on the southern part of Kuta beach, so it's really close to the hustle and bustle of the town. Within minutes you can be in the middle of the famous shops of Kuta, the restaurants, as well as the air conditioned mall nearby. It has a sizeable pool, with restaurant, and one beachfront restaurant. Yes many sellers there but they are friendly and won't bother you like in Thailand. The first time there which is a few years ago we stayed at a bungalow. For a quieter beach you may want to go north in Seminyak area. I have been to Bali 6 times and stayed here twice. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Good for kids. Definitely recommend.

For someone just arriving in Bali this may get your attention, but not for long. The beach is somewhat dirty, the surfing isn´t very good and the harassment from vendors is just unbearable. There are many other options in Bali for a better beach experience.

It was our last day in Bali and my friends wanted to do some last minute shopping but I didn't. What's great about this area is- right behind this big mall is Kuta beach. So while they did their shopping, I got a tan for a souvenir. I was surprised that it wasn't the beach a lot of blogs warned me of. It was pretty quiet and not too full of beach-goers. ( I visited in September 2013)
To cap off our week-long Bali stay, we stayed for the sunset as we sipped our mocktails at the nearby - expensive looking Ocean's 27 Beach Club and Grill. Since we were trying to spend all our Rupiahs, we weren't if it were enough to get some drinks here- but lo and behold- the drinks were just about US $2-$3 ! It's a great place to cap off a nice day and watch the sun set in beautiful Kuta.

We took a long stroll from Legian to Kuta beach.

It's fun watching the surfers trying to catch waves. It's also good walking right down in the waters edge as the hawkers don't really seem to approach you.

The beach is full of deck chairs and people having a great time.

It's not the best beach ever, but it's enjoyable all the same.

Kuta beach is the touristy heart of Bali. Full of deck chairs and people wanting to rent out surfboards. If you want peace and quiet then this is not the place to come. It appeals to a certain crowd and if you want to come and watch the sunset and enjoy a few beers then this is certainly the place to do so.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,510,40>===============  
Despite it's reputation, it's a great attraction and full of life. The surf is dangerous though so you need to exercise caution. The best is being able to have that morning swim and that afternoon sunset stroll. Surfing, snacking, just hanging out, is all good. Did not encounter the touts and was not harassed once. For a more sedate experience with deck chairs walk ten minutes to Legian or further to Seminyak.

Went on an early morning beach walk and there was rubbish everywhere. Thankfully it gets picked up later in the morning. Came back in the afternoon with the kids for a swim but just when you want to sit back and relax with a cold beer you are constantly bombarded by touts selling all manner of things, then the massage offerings etc etc. it just never ends! Shame that they spoil what could be a pleasant family afternoon. Will be going to different beach from here on in so we can actually chill out and relax.

Been here for many times. Must visit place every time i come to Bali. Great sunset view and you will see too much crowd at sunset time. The right place for those who want to learn surf. Many people will offer you if you'd like to buy drinks with quite expensive price, but you are free to use their plastic chair & beach umbrella. Just sit down and point your eyes to the sunset while enjoying your drink. Also, It's nice to have your morning jogging time here.

My expectations for Kuta Beach were not very high as I had heard that it was very dirty. I found that the beach was lovely, clean and beautiful. We walked along the beach and had a few people ask us if we'd like to buy drinks etc but we did not feel harassed.
The beach was good for learning to surf as there were some small waves, not rough at all.

The waves all day until 4-5 pm when it gets more relaxed in the water. Not so clean beacuse people just throw or leave their garbage on the beach. They have volunteers from local surf schools that clean the beach...which is very positive. Please keep the beaches of bali clean!

Kuta Beach is one of the best place to catch the sun set. It is considered a very happening beach with lots of beach goers, surfers, local vendors, bars around and even stray dogs too. I find it pretty hard to swim at Kuta beach because of the waves and current and there are so many other things you can do! The wave crashes further away from the shore so it can be good for beginner surfing. Not so much for pro surfers as the waves are not big enough. I prefer renting a boogie board and just float on the water surface and fly with the waves. The locals there rent out these boards and proper surf boards at a reasonable price. Some of them offer to teach you the basics of surfing too. Locals working at the beach are really friendly and approachable. Generally Balinese are pretty laid back with everything. Even better if you have someone who can speak the language to bargain for the best price. Apparently they practice local pricing and tourist pricing.

For families with kids, I urge you to take care of the children. Don't let them go too far out where there are people surfing.

I cant imagine swimming at Kuta beach when you are spoilt for choice with far nicer beaches. Great place to watch the sunset if you can keep the salespeople away long enough to enjoy it. My children did get cheap henna tattoos here for 50k IDR ($5)

I was just enjoying the sunset in the Kuta Beach until a few women came to me and started chatting. I was just being friendly and entertained their question. All of a sudden, they started to offer their services (mani/foot scrub and massage). At first I said no politely but they were so persistent. The lady said the charge for footscrub was RM300k rupiah (SO EXPENSIVE) - and started scrubbing my feet although I said no.

After negotiation I just said I will only take the service if it was IDR100k. Her friends then started doing my nails too although I said no. At first she said she will charge IDR20k then all of a sudden she said wanted IDR50k. I was really pissed and asked her to go away. She then said she would take the IDR20k. More saleswomen came to us as these people doing the scrub and mani.

The service is not that good anyway and it's not worth the money. Do not be too friendly to these people. Just say no and leave. Such a spoiler to the sunset view.

Kuta Beach now is crowded since it has been the famous beach that attract many tourist to come. The beach has low slope that is nice to play sands with your children. On the other hand the high waves but safe beach is good for learning surfing. If you need for sunbath and relax, another beach in Bali may be more appropriate.

Like everyone says, must visit if you're first timer. I would really just recommend Kuta beach solely for surfing. Sea is kinda clean, strong current, crazy waves, perfect for a surfing outing. Other than that, lots of shop and street vendors around. If you plan to buy, please, please and please negotiate until most comfortable price you are willing to pay and make sure you buy them. Enjoy walking by he beach from hard rock Bali until discovery mall, perfect to end your day!

With the many new beaches opened in Bali, Kuta has became an old beach. If you're a first timer, visiting this beach is a must. Though the beach is crowded most of the time (at least every time i stopped by there), the sunset is still amazing. You can have a massage, get your hair braided, do a body surfing or get a fake tattoo there.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,513,30>===============  
quite nice beach, not really a top10 worldwide, but definitely worth checking out and spending some time around.
Kuta beach is a surfers heaven, you got surf lesson spots/rentals literally every 20ft. good place for shopping as well, They might not have the variety of shops but shirts, shorts, towels go for cheap there (just dont forget to bargain as You would do on the street).

I enjoyed sitting down for a beer or two watching locals surf (they are crazy !!) prices are low, as they charge You same as 7/11 (25 for a small Bintang) so its not worth it to carry it from the store.
Walking by is similar to walking the street (i.e. Legian) locals chit-chat You into buying cold drinks from them or renting surf board but they are not as "pushy" as they street counterparts.

Sometimes outside the random beach entrances You can find the "corn on the cob" guys.
I made it my daily routine to walk the Kuta beach and try finding them (sometimes thy weren't there, not even one). Spicy corn is worth trying and costs 10 (of course at first they tell You 50 :)
well, go check it out, see it Yourself

this is one of the great "beach scenes" in the world. First impressions can be overwhelming with the myriad activities and the sight of an long long stretch of coastline with thousands of people and innumerable pop-up beach bars with their attendant satellite businesses of body board and surf board hire and sun lounges to rent by time frame. i spent a memorable day at kuta beach, when I spied a friendly old guy setting up his beach bar early in the morning, and sat on one of the plastic chairs for the next six hours ordering drinks, reading my book, looking up the parade of people and situations, chatting to the proprietor and enjoying the beautiful balmy weather and taking it easy. This is one way of approaching a day at the beach here in Bali. There are countless others - its all up to how active or inactive you want to be. there are surf lessons to be had and hawkers to buy things from and locals to talk to to get the low down on how the system works socially and economically on the beach. Kuta beach is a glorious creation early in the day when the sea is calmer for swimming and the light is gentle, before the heat sets in and the place takes on another character. relax, be open and enjoy the scenery!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,513,40>===============  
Very nice view, crowded domestic & int'l tourists. A little bit too dirty. Lots of other more private, cleaner and nicer Beach in Bali for more perfect beach. Only the crowd is the advantage of this beach.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,514,40>===============  
The beach itself is fantastic, golden sand beach that stretches off into the far distance with an endless view of the horizon over the ocean.
The water is fairly shallow, so it's great to splash around in the shallows, but as you move further out beware that the surf picks up and there are a lot of surfers (Great place to learn to surf though), additionally the surf produces a strong undercurrent that can make it difficult to swim.
The beach is different however, there are merchants who patrol the beach endlessly trying to sell you stuff, which is great except if you don't want anything as often they are really persistent. They have no qualms attempting to wake you if you are or are feigning sleep. On the flip side you can rent a chair or a lounger, and have ice-cold drinks to you were you sit, additionally if you're keen to learn to surf you couldn't throw a stone without hitting a instructor for hire.
If you prefer there are similar beaches with much less commercialism, you just need to go look for them.

We went to Kuta beach and were devoured by locals who painted my toenails, massaged my back, braided my young daughter`s hair before we even said yes! All this while my husband went surfing! Our daughter ended up in tears.They carried our bag without permission! We had $AU1700 stolen out of our money traveller card! Commonwealth Bank and QBE travel insurance would not help!

This time we stayed at the Kuta Beach Heritage hotel which was just across the road from the beach. Took a quick stroll on the beach one day. Far too crowded with vendors and tourists; guess it's OK if you are a surfer or sun-bather. Also interesting for people-watching. Took some pics and left through the Kuta Art Market. On a previous visit, we had a great lunch on the beach at the Inna hotel.

I suppose you would expect this being right in the middle of Kuta, but after day 2, we avoided this beach like the plague.
It is a pretty beach with lots to see and do. But the local people trying to sell merchandise and massages etc, it is just so frustrating.

Oh and I loved the turtle man! Check it out for sure, and put your name down to see the mums hatch their eggs (we got a call at our hotel at 3am to go down to the beach and watch, just magical!)

Kuta beach is a gorgeous place to dip the toes in and walk along, soaking up the sun and the smells of people cooking just off the beach. The main stretch of beach was lovely with cool water and warm sand, but if you go up a little further (where you have to go in order to reach the beach), connecting the beach to the land there are many locals all hassling passers by to buy their wares. If you just ignore them, this beach is a wonderful little spot of sunshine in a very busy Bali.

Yes touristy
Yes more casual surfers who don't know what they are doing and run over young kids
Did I say crowded? Yes I did

We have been going to Bali for 25 years and the beach was always something we avoided. We're Australians, we already have the best beaches in the world! But lately we have come to appreciate this local experience and have been charmed. It's certainly much cleaner, have whiter and more comfortable sand, probably imported from Oz, than those first years two decades ago. Gone also are the hordes of beach sellers that would hassle you without mercy and the gangs of 8 year old pick pocket experts.

The kids loved the mild surf, got hassled by local Balinese for photos (my kids are cute), made sand castles and could spend hours in the warm water.

Kuta Beach is for surfers only. Do not go here if you would like a beach swim, or to relax on a beach chair. It is full of vendors trying to sell you everything from watches to wooden dart guns. You can hire a beach chair and umbrella for roughly $RP50,000 ($AUD5) for about two hours (you will have to barter - or keep walking to Legian for a cheaper price). The sand is fine but a yellowy/black colour. In the mornings, there are nice shells and coral washed up; it is also quieter at this time. Don't even think about going from 4pm onwards - this is when busloads of Javanese arrive to catch the sunset. Walk up to Legian or Seminyak (it will still be packed but not as much) to see the sunset but don't blink or you'll miss it (it happens rapidly).

If you a surfer, then it is right place for you.
Otherwise, you should avoid to visit kuta and bali. There is nothing unique. Narrow roads, many people, many motos and cars, horrible!
We also got some very bad experiences with Australian in our hotel. After we just went out for a lunch or went back room for a half hour rest , our deck chairs were occupied, even there were still some deck chairs free!!! the Aussies(2days,different people) just took our couches without any reason.

Try to get a nice spot for you (especially when waiting for the sunset). The beach tends to get a bit crowded at the end of the day. Before you settle down in your chosen spot, you might want to buy a cold beverage first from one of the vendors near the boundary. Better yet, to be economical, bring your own beverage (prices by the beach for anything get a bit expensive).

After doing some online research, via TripAdvisor mostly, but a few lists of top 10 things to do in Bali, most mentioned Kuta Beach. Our resort (outside the touristy areas) provided us a free shuttle to Kuta so we ended up near a market area. Our goal was the beach, but many shops enticed us to spend our time elsewhere. Yep, lots of good shopping if that's your thing.

The beach was pretty easy to get to. Just ask any local and they'll point you in the right direction. My friends and I ended up near McDonald's and it was a quick turn to the beach!!

Beach: On this beach you will find tourists and locals alike sharing the beautiful sand, waves and views. The waves on the west coast of Bali are notoriously rougher than the east coast, but once you get out of the breaks, its rather calm. My friends and I enjoyed jumping in waves and floating around until the sun set. A beautiful view on a beautiful beach.

Amenities: You will find your fill of hockers of any and all goods. From head hammocks (you'll see them!) to jewelry to ice cream you can buy it all! As far as I could see or find- no public toilets. Its bring your own everything, but I'm sure someone will offer you a plastic chair, for a price.

Overall: a great beach with a local feel. Not once did I feel threatened or unsafe. Beach was clean and tourists and locals alike were enjoying its magnificence. Go before sunset and enjoy the views

I have traveled to many beaches in Asia and I was really looking forward to my trip to Paradise (Bali). What a disappointment. The infrastructure (roads) are bad, one lane in/out to Kuta beach and most places. Traffic is backed up on most days and once that you finally arrive at Kuta beach, get ready for the let down. Overcrowded, un kept and just not that great. I would prefer the New Jersey shore over this place.

This is a pretty beach. Very busy, but pretty. The ability to buy nearly anything is good but, beware. If you buy 1 thing, expect to be swamped by 100s of sellers all in your face and, wont take no for an answer. While we were there, the surf was below average, but sightseeing was amazing.

One of the best beaches I have ever visited

It remains crowded with foreigners and has one of the best facilities. Crystal clear waters and perfect temperature with no litters.

Ample of hotels nearby and so are the restaurants including Mc Donald, KFC

It was wonderful beach with long sandy beach. When I went there it was around 7pm. It was little bit of dark there. Moonlight was on the show. I wish I could stay further. But this is balli. Little bit of scary about locals hanging there. But I hope to visit there again. Only thing I hate balli is money. I was fedup with counting money...

What a horrible place.
Dirty beaches, unfriendly locals (unless they have to be ie working in the resort) they are all trying to get money from you any way they can and the shopping is a rip off, not to mention the corrupt as hell police what a joke.
Dont support this yuk corrupt place,
save your money go to Koh Samui Thailand instead its a much better place for an tropical asian experience.

The beach itself was amazing and unlike anything I'd seen. I wanted a relaxing day to lay, but I got the opposite. Vendors approaching every 3 min, random males trying to talk to us to "practice english" and attempt to take our pictures, constant recruitment for surf lessons. Was amusing at first, but got old quick.

It would have been much more enjoyable if we had males with us to fend off the other "curious" approachers.

Cheap surf lessons can be arranged for around 150,000 rupiah per person if you haggle.

Would go back to surf, not to relax. Looking forward to more secluded beaches elsewhere. 2 day visit maximum

Had to pay to use bathroom.

LOVELY SUNSET

Just a stone's throw away from the busy streets, Kuta Beach is clean and well-maintained. It's not really for swimming, though. The waves can be overwhelming. It's more for surfing. Surfers can rent surfboards from the local vendors.

Kuta beach is one of the best island in Bali, it has a beautiful 180 degrees of view along the beach and you can watch sunset everyday (whenever the sky is not cloudy nor rain) with a spectacular view.

The wave, Kuta Beach also have a variety spot of wave from a small and tidy wave into a strong kind for surfing or body boarding.

Or you can just relax spending a nice warm sunbathing on the beach while reading your favorite books or just taking a little nap and your skins will be tanned in no time.

We spent a few hours over a couple if days at Kuta Beach.
There is lots to see with the surfing lessons going on & just people watching.
If you thought you could go there to chill, relax & get peace & quiet, you are mistaken.
We hired a couple of loungers & umbrella on one of the days & no sooner had we sat down, within a minute we had 4 women hassling us for the usual-massage, jewellery, drinks. They just would not go away, they kept coming back, it was very frustrating & annoying. A lesson I will learn for next time.
The surf was lovely to cool down in and de-stress but unfortunately my partner got bitten by so much sea lice it was unbelievable. I didn't spend as long in the water as he did so came out fine. Bit of a shame.

I had heard about the difference between hawkers from Java and Bali but it wasn't until I took my two young kids down kuta beach that I really understood. Bali hawkers would be smiling and happy whereas the hawkers on Kuta beach were predominately from Java. I found them pushy and insistent and really quite intimidating (and I'm an experienced barter!) I sat with my 10yo daughter as she had her hair braided and there were 5-6 extra ladies trying to sell us bracelets, nail painting, drinks, massage, that wouldn't leave us alone the entire time... Laying on a guilt trip telling me I'm depriving them of food if I don't buy things! My youngest (6yo) buried her head in my lap as they wouldn't stop touching her. Wish we had just gone into one of the many beauty shops and had her hair done!! Some people probably like this atmosphere but it wasn't for us. Beach itself was ok. Quite clean. Lots of people. Sand too hot to walk on during the day.

The Kuta Beach is the most crowded beach as always. It's not white sand but it's located in the heart of the city so for people who don't really want to travel far to find a white sand beach, this is a better option to surf and swim with the waves.

Kuta, Legian, Seminyak is one beach. Long with good surf. Nice to sit in shade under trees or on a beach bed and umbrella. Great for a beer and to watch the sunset.

BUT there are many sewer runs. Walking along the beach from Kuta to Seminyak at sunset was at first pleasant but when we had to cross streams of sewage water from land to sea it was not so. Passed by a wedding on the beach but congregation would have had to put up with pretty awful smell.

There isn't much to the beach itself, I'd say it caters mostly to surfers because other than that it's only good for people watching. If you're after a beautiful beach to swim and relax in, this is not the beach for you. If you're looking to learn how to surf, don't mind paying to use the sun beds, staying at an overdeveloped beach, and love to be in crowded beaches to people watch then this would be in ideal spot.

Not for us. Luckily we are blessed with sensational beaches and sunsets over the ocean at home. The experience of sharing it with hundreds of tourists at Kuta is not a great one. The ladies selling their wares and massages would not leave my family, including 4 children, alone. I thought buying a sarong and a massage would satisfy them, but no. They must just laugh at the gullible tourists, myself included, at the end of each day. Not relaxing at all and certainly nothing special.

Because we have the best beaches in the world in Western Australia, I am quite biased! I do not swim or surf or get in the ocean in Bali - the waves are good but the water seems dirty/rubbishy. Although, admittedly, now that they have scheduled cleaning twice a day on Kuta beach, things are looking much nicer. Still - to me, the best use of the beach in Bali is to sit back and chill out at the many beach 'bars', wander up and down in the shade and check out the hawkers and food carts.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,523,30>===============  
I may be breaking many a hearts, but the Kuta beach is, well, just another nice tropical waterfront. Period!
The water is predictably but not exceptionally azure, the surfs are the right frothy white but nothing spectacular, the sand is smooth and free of flotsam - in one word, usual.
Yes, there are the predictable gathering of (mostly Aussies, a sprinkling of the orientals, handful of locals) bare bodied sunbathers, amateur surfers, beach bums, occasional voyeurs,
hobbyist snappers (yours truly included) and so on so forth.
But frankly it's a bit too crowded for comfort.
Rows of beer vendors, surfboard depots, roaming masseurs, souvenir hawkers and recliner renters make this even more congested.

Thankfully the entire beachfront is highwalled from the lovely promenade housing posh hotels, classy restaurants / bars, nightclubs and an impressive Hard Rock Cafe.

Vehicular traffic, though heavy, is well behaved and tourists can trudge through without problem.

The highlight is the lovely shopping mall "Beachwalk", with ultra modern architecture but exquisite Balinese touches.
View from the rooftop bar is amazing and one can cover the entire arc of Kuta beach right from the airport runway till the west where a lovely summer sun would set down every evening amongst a coconut grove.

If you are looking for a peaceful stretch of pristine sand facing a more exotic blue sea, head to Sanur.

It's way less crowded even in peak August, noise levels are barely audible, the hotels look classier and very few vendors.

Though Legian strip bang next to Kuta beach is a great place to shop ( and there are some really good food joints - Mama's is a must and the Starbucks in the 101 complex is awesome) - try Ubud for a truly international grade Hugh street experience.

Ubud is another hyperactive destination though, so, it's best for a day trip.

The beach is broad strip of sand and the waves are high so it might be good for surfing.

To be fair I think this is a personal opinion raher than the objectivity I like to bring to my reviews. Lets be clear unless you are under 25 and like Aussie culture you shouldnt be in Kuta anyway. So when I say its full of (very) young people learning to surf this may be good. The surf didnt look very challeging to me if youre a superstar by the way. You can sit at the side and drink a coke/beer at one of the many stalls for about US$1.50 upwards. Locals will pester you but they soon go away if you are unfriendly (thats the trick by the way). So for me a neutral experience but I wont be back.

Miles and miles of beautiful beach, amazing sand, clean water along side of Kuta's busy metropolis of city shopping and markets, hotels and bars!

Kuta Beach is one of those must see cultural experiences when you're visiting Bali. But only if you have lots of patience! As soon as you walk onto the sand you are hassled from left right and centre for massages, bracelets sarongs you name it!

You can release the turtles into the ocean at the right time of year. Have fun

My visit before this is more than three years a go and I notice this central attraction in Kuta has improved a lot. Hundreds of meters of white sandy beach is now getting cleaner, I believe the Sheraton hotel which just opened in Beach Walk has major contribution to initiate the improvement. Your kids (or even you) can get your hair done in island style for IDR 100K or less. The coconut is overpriced for locals but the beverages is modarate.

I had less than 24 hrs to explore Bali and I spent most of the night walking. I had no idea behind that beautiful wall there was a beach. What I did not like was the horse carriages They are forced to run on the asphalt all day and all night wearing masks and blinders in major pollution with no water. No breaks ,and if they do stop their legs are trembling with exhaustion and the driver will continuously whip them to seem more perky..I am going to file complaints with whoever will listen. Not too many Americans go there but if they do ,my review will be the first thing they see.

Our hotel was on a fantastic stretch of beautiful clean beach and clear water. We like to explore when we travel and Kuta beach was said to be worth a visit for surfing. I know the bars and clubs are lively at night but the beach was seriously disappointing. The local people are lovely and we did have such a laugh as we wandered along the beach but we didn't stay on the beach as it was packed chronic and the dirtiest beach I have ever seen anywhere. Bottles, tins, plastic bags and cigarette butts literally everywhere. I thought it was packed and dirty for a reason like after a festival but met some great Aussie girls who said it was always like it. We had a few drinks and great food and left. No surfing for us. I wouldn't go back.

I think Kuta beach is the most famous beach in Bali, since people always mention this beach if they refer to Bali. I used to be a nice beach. But now it is getting really crowded and some people just threw trash anywhere they want.
People or surfer use to watch sunset by the side of the beach.It is one of the best spot to see the sunset in Bali.
In this beach you can easily find people who sell like sarong bali, offering a tatto, or braided your hair. but make sure to bargain them, they usually put high price for tourist/foreigners

It's not the beach itself that makes this place because it will never compare to the beaches in Australia. It's the beautiful, smiling, fun loving Balinese and other Indonesians that make their living working on the beach eg beach bars, massage, selling everything etc. Be polite and have fun with them, it's all what makes the holiday worth while, not to mention the best weather ever is the dry season, no bloody rain.

Going by the names of bali beaches, the kuta beach does not able to impress that much.
beach water is not that much clean but still a great place just to sit & relax
one can surf there & rent it & also learn the same from guide at nominal price
situated close to the local & mall market but I found this market costly compared to the other part of bali.

I must say that the wave of sea is very impressive in Bali compare to other countries in Asia (by far I had visited).

Even not doing any swimming activities but just a leisure morning walk on the beach already made my day!

Kuta Beach looks so cozy and peaceful to me at the morning time, not very crowded. Water is clear and sand is fine.

We were anxious about the weather before we reached Bali, it was forecast for March as very stormy. In reality there was an occasional short heavy shower, and the temperature was always warm. The rain was never a problem, don't be deterred from going at that time of year.

The currents of the sea wash some awful rubbish onto Kota beach; it's okay on the beach itself, but in the water, what a horror, rubbish everywhere. If you want to swim, go to another side of the island; it's okay for surfing at Kuta.

On the beach the locals have impromptu bars, very nice to sit there for a while; you'll be prey to all the roving sellers, who are polite but persistent.

That same persistence is evident throughout all the roads and alleys of the town, both roving street peddlers and shop keepers too. Viagra, anything you can imagine, and a few things you wouldn't want to imagine. It does get tedious. It won't stop us going back, but it's a severe drawback.

Everything is cheaply priced, and most of it is poor quality. Fake branding is everywhere. Don't try to take anything back, this street trader (in my photo) was quite nasty when I went back within 24 hours with an item which had just fallen apart.

The locals are very charming, but not all those selling are locals, so be very discerning.

It's probably not a very nice place for women travelling on their own, or just with other women, unless you are very assertive.

The White Rose is a nice retreat, centrally placed, if your budget stretches that far.

Have I made it sound too awful? I hope not, because there's enough there to make it very enjoyable; maybe we were expecting too much, and arriving from Sydney with all its cleanliness & charm, we were initially disappointed. Unlike a visit to Thailand, where one can enjoy the local culture, in this part of Bali you just accept the merging of Indonesian charm with the more tasteless aspects of "Western" living.

Watch out for the entry & exit visa costs, they like to grab solid foreign currency whenever possible. You really do need that in cash.

Any money changer with a higher than normal rate is a cheat, they will keep half or more than half in a trick, I caught them twice and had an argument with them. I found vast majority if people from taxi drivers to tour operators, and shopkeepers, most of them are cheats and are only active in there best effort to take as much out of tourists, hated the place after spending a week in Bali. Never coming again.

Kuta beach is definitely not for swimming or for newbie surfers. If you are looking for a good place to start your surfing career this could be a great help as the locals offer a low rate which I find is pretty reasonable. Be cautious of the ladies who sell bracelets and gives massages, they are a bit aggressive and can get a little pushy with you. Know how to say 'no' and they will leave you alone.

I think kuta beach is one big icon of bali, a must visit beach when you in bali. About 30 minutes from the airport you can get here easily. The beach have a white sands and a turqoise water. It's quite when you visit on low season but it's gonna be over crowd when you visit here on weekend or on high season of holiday. You can enjoy this beach for free if you don't rent a chair. It's a lil bit hard to get car parking.

Kuta beach is the supposed "best" beach in Bali. Its a big and wide beach, with a lot of people, mostly foreigners. The waves are pretty good, which makes surfing doable. However, due to the large waves it is not good for children. The sand is also gray. and it is not as clean as most of the beaches I have gone to. Philippine beaches are far better. If you are not staying in a hotel along the beach, there are public shower areas and toilets, but it is not the most convenient setup as well.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,527,30>===============  
The beach is quite rough, the sand is not white, but is very good to do the surf. The surrounding is just like any big city in the world. The only good thing that I impressed when I was there is Bali New year. We got there during Bali New year , so we got to see all the ceremony. Beautiful costume, and nice performance.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,527,30>===============  
All though kuta beach is a must do experience in Bali there are a lot of much much nicer beaches out there.

Kuta is there for it's people watching, tout talking and activities.

Don't expect to relax on the beach as you will most certainly have someone coming up to you every few minutes trying to sell you everything from shells to bow and arrows. Depending on what mood you are in this can be great fun talking to the locals who are just trying to make a living to a down right annoyance. My recommendation is to try and take it in your stride.

We rented boogie boards whilst we were there and had a great time. Just watch out for those dumping waves!

A bit back from the beach there are also a few restaurant gems that are good value for money.

In conclusion go for the excitement and relax elsewhere! :)

Was the most amazing experience. Been o Bali more than 10 times now and never realised the amount of turtle activity on kuta beach. Got to do a large turtle release which was great for the kids and adults alike. During the day kuta beach is very busy with way too many halkers. Do not get henna on the beach tattoos as known too many people have major reactions, for a quieter and safer beach to swim head a little further up towards legian

I've never seen a beach as dirty as Kuta is - very hard sands and garbage everywhere, this is quite disappointed.

But it is also a very nice place to go, many restaurants and shopping malls and bars, quite crowded but with friendly people.

By drinking a bottle of iced Bintan Beer while watching the sunset in front of Kuta beach is one of the most beautiful thing to do in Bali days. Go for yours.

Water is murky and sand is brown, but the waves are decent size and fun to play around in. We got hassled on the beach several times by vendors, but that is just par for the course on big, public beaches in Bali, I guess.

I visited Kuta in February this year and also two years ago in March and both visits the beach was disappointing. It is filthy, strewn with rubbish and I would not recommend swimming there.

Hotel photos are really conniving and although they do try their best to clean the beach area in front of their resort daily, you still can't hide the rubbish floating in the beach water and therefore can't swim at the beach anyway.... if you really wanted to swim at the beach I would highly recommend not.

If you are also staying in Bali and not staying at one of these beach front hotels, which take up pretty much the whole stretch of Kuta, Nusa Dua and Seminyak, then you cannot lay on the clean sand unless you are a hotel guest and unfortunately would have to lay among the rubbish. I much preferred just staying at my hotel swimming pool to be the honest.

I also couldn't visit anywhere on the beach without unfortunately being haggled and harassed by vendors trying to sell whatever knock off product they had.

There are much better beaches in Bali and I would recommend visiting another for a nice day at the beach.

Bustling, popular beach in Bali, but has become a little too hectic and noisy for me. Crowded with noisy/ boisterous surfer crowd who think they own the town - esp around the pub area. Family vacations are more suited towards Seminyak/ Sanur beach. Bali is indeed a beautiful island - its beauty is infectious.

Hello Everyone,

This is my 2nd review about the beach in Bali. Honestly, I was at the beach while I'm review this place. In my opinion this beach is central for entertainment and attractions that very near with Airport. Many people tells me that this place is "MUST VISIT" place when you go to Bali.

This place is crowded than the other beach and I don't know why? (maybe near airport and so many advertising that advertise this place). This beach suitable for hang out, surfing, tattoo place (usually some people offering it in the beach.. :)). For budgeted traveler, I recommend KFC and Mcdonald's to hang out in terms of price.. hehehe

So, when you go to Bali, this is 1st place that I recommend to come and enjoyed. Have a nice trip to Kuta Beach...

Thanks

Rezy

I was in Kuta in 2012 and the beach was really clean as was the water. I took my 2 year old daughter swimming which I wouldn't do if it was filthy. Maybe storms caused all the rubbish in January this year which seems to be when many reviews were written regarding the subject. We avoided Kuta beach for 3 weeks for the very reason it was grubby, only to be pleasantly surprised and annoyed we hadn't gone earlier. I'm back in a week so I guess I'll find out. But there's nothing better than pulling up a bean bag at about 5pm, bit of doof doof music pumping, ordering a pizza & a Bintang , and watching your baby playing with the local kids while the sun sets. It's awesome. Can't wait to get back to a hopefully clean yet chaotic Kuta.

Expected Bali to be a paradise. Instead all we saw was rubbish everywhere but the sea around Kuta Beach was really gross. I swam all day and I was constantly surrounded by Plastic rubbish in the water. Tip, Go to Thailand or Cambodia, they do it better for less.

We entered the beach through the Jl Melasti road. The gate going in the beach looked really nice. There were many umbrellas with chairs for rent and of course our mistake was as soon as we entered we got a chair with umbrella right away to put our stuff and get some shade NOT knowing that that area has a red flag which means NO SWIMMING is allowed because of the dangerous waves...Thing is we already paid 100,000 rupiah for the umbrella and chairs so we were stuck already. Better to walk farther from the gate...towards the right. Sea waves are calmer...Although my kids enjoyed the big waves....I was not too scared because they are varsity swimmers but if your kids are not good swimmers then I do not recommend that you stay in that spot coz the waves can drag them into the sea. It is not deep but waves were so powerful that it can easily make you fall down. It was a great experience. I just hated the vendors selling their stuff which is irritating when you are trying to relax. They offer massage ( not worth it at all), henna tattoos, ice cream, boat/ surf board/ rental. I wish we can just put a sign which say DO NOT DISTURB...We will just call you when we need you!!. Water had some trash like plastic bags, wrappers..dont be surprised if it clings to your leg but I think they try to sweep whatever goes to the shore. All in all though it was a good experience. Next time we will try the beaches in Nusa Dua area.

It seem like the surfer paradise. Beautiful huge waves and very blue sky. But the beach was very dirty....there are alot of rubbish and also lot of cigarette butts and the clear look very dirty too.

The Kuta beach is one of the most dirty beach in Bali. As soon as you get in the water, you would want to get out. The colour of the water itself makes you wonder why they advertise so much about it. The water is polluted and can barely enjoy the water as you have to avoid multiple wastes being thrown on you by the waves. The beach may have a lot of people mostly for the sun but the sea makes the place horrible. Seminyak beach is better than this.

Kuta beach and the length some kilometres to the North is a rubbish strewn disgrace for Bali.
The shoreline is a mixture of food containers, plastic bags, broken glass and worse.
It is certainly not safe to let children play on this beach, or indeed anyone to walk around barefoot.
I sincerely hope the Balinese authorities take some urgent action quickly.

Pop down for sunset and you will be offered a chair and a Bintang for 25,000 Rph ($2 USD) and watch the sun go down - great! It's a bit of a Bali ritual but one everyone should do once. It is also nice to see the Aussie surf lifesavers have been busy in Kuta and that the flags are up on the beach in more than one location all day and there is now some safe swimming between the flags, under the watchful eye of Aussie trained surf lifesavers and occasional real ones from Australia.

If you are going to Bali this is a must do just to say you have done it. You will be hassled relentlessly by people selling beer, seating, bracelets, kites, artwork, and more, and more, and more. They will not take no for an answer easily. I swam in the water - it was like swimming in a rubbish tip, excepting it was meant to be the sea. It is not seaweed that washes around you but waste!

For spending time to relax until sunset at KB, travelers can buy soft drink to seller and then they lend a small chair for relaxing.
While relaxing and enjoy to see blue deep seawater, traveler can order to body massage with cost Rp. 50K around 30-45 minutes. Masseur massage to partly of my body, for example: leg, arms, shoulder etc.

Long beach in Kuta just near all malls markets and shopping opportunity street in Kuta center. Uggly place with totally lost "genius loci" (no more shining and romantical place!). Every wave is full of absolute beginners with surf and surfing comedy starts from morning till to evening.

The money changers along Kuta Beach are all fraudsters and trying to rob you. They have so many tricks to cheat you by giving you lesser currency as compared to what is as per the exchange rate or even pocketing a few of your currency notes and claiming you gave them less money to begin with.

This kind of cheating makes the whole tourist experience sour and leaves such a bad taste in the mouth. Do not trust the people of Bali as they seem to be very simple and religious on the outside but inside they are nothing but petty thieves and cheats.

I should have listened to my friend's advice not going there, yet since Kuta Beach is the most "famous" beach in Bali, we figured might as well kick off our first day in Bali there. You know what, big mistake! The sand is rocky and trashy, everywhere people trying to sell you things one after another. The water was ok, but eveything else there just put us in a not so pleasant mood. If I were officials of Bali, I'd definitely clean up the place and change things around, afterall it is one of the most popular spot of the island. Oh well...

What a shame this beach has transformed into a rubbish dump. When you look from the street through one of the picturesque gates, the water and beach look quite inviting. Upon having a closer look and trying to get to the water its a different story. You have to wade through a whole lot of rubbish , from plastic bottles to wrappers, general plastic and even used condoms to get to the water. I stepped in to cool my feet off and while was walking along plastic bags wrapped themselves around my ankles.
It is beyond my understanding how people can be so ignorant of all this dirt and sit on this beach or go for a swim in such a rubbish soup. Utterly disgusting.

We were at the beach around 5pm, it was low tide. What we saw was....rubbish everywhere on the beach and in the water, black colour mud or sands. The most dirty beach we have ever seen. We walked on the beach carefully with our shoes on! It is very irritated when the wave comes in, the rubbish gets washed away by the waves and comes back with the muddy water so the wave comes in first, covering your feet with the water, then the rubbish comes camouflaged in the water so it feels like seaweed. It seems nobody care about the cleanness of the beach. Come before low tide, it is nice and good for surfing, as you won't see the rubbish under your feet.

Kuta beach is by far the most crowded beach in Bali. From the road to the entrances down to the beach area, it is filled with sea of people. This is partially due to the huge number of hotels situated within walking distance to the beach.

If you don't mind the excessive crowd you can go to Kuta beach.

Otherwise Seminyak beach is a much bettter choice. Cleaner and less crowded.

Kuta beach is probably one of the most dirty beach that I came across in Bali, considering the fact that there are literally tons of random garbage scattered around in specific areas.
However, in exchange Kuta beach has a lot of surfers due to its consistent waves, and the sunset on Kuta beach was definitely one of the best sunset I've ever seen in Bali.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,532,30>===============  
I was in Bali from the 3rd-8th and decided to come here for the day on my final day...

The good: The water looks very nice and the surf looked absolutely amazing. Many people were out surfing and enjoying themselves. It was great to watch.

The bad: Like many other reviews have said, as soon as you get on the beach you are pestered to buy things. The Balinese locals, while many of them are nice people, know that a lot of tourists come to Kuta and particularly the beach because it is so nice, so they will hit you up trying to sell you a variety of things: drugs, shirts, bracelets, surf lessons, drinks, etc. The best way to handle this is just hold you hand up and say "No thank you" and continue walking. If you hesitate and talk to them, you'll never get away...

The ugly: Pollution! I saw many bottles, glasses, and debris washed up on shore and it really kills the area for me. It is well hidden because the beach itself is quite long, wide, so you can won't see it until you step closer to the water and away from the people selling you things.

All in all, the water is nice and well worth the look, but perhaps from one of the restaurants across the street. I enjoyed a sunset while eating pancakes at Flapjaks across the street and wasn't pestered by anyone, so I enjoyed it.

Gotta say this has to be one of the best beaches to look at from a distance. Entering the surf however gives you the creeps as there is so much garbage in the water. It sticks to you and you cannot get away from it, you even feel bad to open your mouth in the water. Really needs some work from local government urgently.

We were on a cruise and we tendered overnight in Bali, the 1st day we decided to just get a taxi and go to a nice beach we ended up on Kuta beach. The moment you step on the beach you are pestered you don't get 2 minutes peace, we walked up the beach to try and find somewhere clean to sit, that's impossible as rubbish is washed up with every wave. I have never been any where so bad, you can't even walk in the sea as you have rubbish is being washed up.
The thing is its a very pretty beach it could be so nice if only it was kept clean something really needs to be done. I did like the writing that was on the sun beds "keep Bali beaches clean" if only.

It is a lovely long sandy beach with a short but fairly steep drop in the sand to the water. There are lifeguards on duty As soon as you step on the beach you will be constantly pressed to buy everything under the sun.

It's a busy beach, with numerous tourists and tour operators plying their trade. During February the beach was very clean and had a small surf. Being from Sydney, good beaches are hard to find. Go elsewhere for peace and quiet and more stunning options. Seminyak Beach I found to be quite pretty.

This beach is known to be one of, if not, THE most popular beach in Bali??? I seriously wonder why. I was more than dissappointed. The sand and water is polluted and the beach itself is nothing special...Totally overrun with tourists and drunken australians. Highly overrated

Went to Kuta beach since I've heard a alot about this beach and apparently it's known to be the most popular beach in Bali. Though the sunset was fantastic and very picturesque but I think of this beach to be over-hyped!
The beach is so dirty with plastic litter, beer bottles, etc... There seems to be no efforts of maintaining it. We wanted to get in the water but seeing the litter everywhere really had put us off! Stray dogs running around on the beach and the sand was also not clean.
Bali has better beaches to relax and bask! Jimbaran beach is much cleaner and a quieter place to relax.
I won't suggest you to get in the waters of Kuta beach. Though you will find many surfers but check out better beaches in Bali. This place seems to be so popular coz of great restaurants and pubs close-by.
But..... Do not miss the sunset here, its wonderful!

This was once a beautiful, fairly clean, beach. There have always been vendors (I have been coming here for about 30 years), but nothing like what is seen today. Unfortunately, even though there are people assigned to clean the beach on a regular basis, it is still littered with various forms of plastic, discarded food cartons, etc.
All of this does not detract from the beauty of the sunsets. If you can find a fairly quiet area, just relax, have a beer, and enjoy it on a beautiful evening.
Bali really needs some regulation of plastic bottles and other plastic trash!

Who doesn't like a nice relaxing time sitting on the beach, or on the beds right up along the waterfront.
If you don't like hassle then I wouldn't suggest you even step foot on the beach. We knew exactly what was coming, so we ordered out drinks straight away. Had my nails done, foot massage and bought some bracelets (20,000 so she would actually leave us alone) but its a great atmosphere if you like that kind of thing!
But we know we paid WAYYYYY too much to get pampered on the beach, the little 'spas' are wayyyyyyyyy cheaper and generally do a better job.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,534,20>===============  
As picturesque as Kuta beach looks from a distance, the water is strewn with plastic litter and swimming is a mad dash to avoid being covered in trash, There are daily sand sweeps to collect the rubbish as the tides brings it in, but there is so very much that its an ongoing challenge, I first visited Bali in the early 80's - there was little in way of rubbish collection and recycling back then. Despite the !000's of tourist $ being spent daily Bali still has a long way to go with developing effective recycling infrastructure and garbage disposal systems. Educating both locals and tourists to care more and waste less doesn't appear to be working, Not sure I want to see it in another 20 years!

Kuta beach is a crowded beach and it was not clean at all, i won't suggest you to swim even though a lot of people still do surfing here. I can only tell you that it has beautiful sunset. A lot of rubbish and dogs were running around in this beach, the sand was not clean because of that

What a shame , the beach is literally smothered in garbage, it is a health hazard and should be an embarrassment to the locals.

This area is full of tourists. The Beachwalk mall is located here, housing a lot of branded stores, and other shops. Mata Hari Dept Store in Kuta Square has a lot of souvenirs. A lot of shops sell cheap versions of branded sunglasses such as Rayban, Oakley.

Don't waste your time with Kuta Beach (or any public beach), it's full of trash in and out the water, you will definitely hurt yourself if you walk barefoot on these. People will try to sell you stuff every 2 seconds. As for surfing, quite frankly I don't get why people are so enthusiastic, I'm not a surfer but those waves seem super small and slow. And you'll end up swallowing trash (yay)

During our stay in Bali, we went a few other beaches in addition to Kuta. The proximity to the hotels and airport and just the overall experience of being there and watching the sunset was fantastic. This is our beach of choice for our next trip to Bali. Plenty of vendors for drinks, umbrellas or mats to be had. Values were good and as I said, the sunset was spectacular. Bali is a tourist trap particularly at the beaches, but even with that, I would go back in a second. Low keyed, restful and a real break from where I was. I don't make a habit of going to the same places usually but I would go there again.

While the waves might be good for beginner surfers, nothing about this beach offers relaxation or fun. Between the endless rubbish on the beach and in the water. You cannot walk/sit/lounge without someone trying to sell you something including the place you are sitting.

Unfortunately I was very disappointed by the large amounts of garbage on the beach due to rainy season currents. However, I was impressed with the regular efforts to clean it up.
It is a nice wide beach, with great swells for beginning surfers.
There are many vendors along the way, selling all sorts of goods, and constantly asking for your business.
Kuta is very busy, loud and has an active night scene.

Great beach with lotsa people! You can find people selling drinks, picnic mats, shades, hand-made stuff and many more. You can also do surfing as the waves were perfect for surfing. Paid 150,000 for 2 hours of surfing. For the 1st hour, they will guide and teach you how to do it. For the next hour, you can surf on your own. It was a great experience, i was so tired, didn't last for 2 hours though! i definitely enjoyed myself!

I think everyone knew about Kuta Bali, yeah it's a good beach.
It was nice to enjoy the sunset here, you can lay down on the sand and hear the sound of waves.
It's good when you enjoy the moment with your couple, but if you are a single traveler just like me, should be fine.

I hope people who comes to Kuta can keep the cleanliness of this beach.

Cheers!!

Winds from the west bring huge amounts of plastic rubbish to the beach this time of year. 2014 was far worse than ever.

Dirtiest beach I have ever seen. Every step you take, someone comes over trying to sell you something - bracelets, surf board rental and even crossbows!

I'd heard so much about the infamous Kuta Beach, but perhaps because I'm Australian and used to beautiful beaches, I wasn't much impressed.

My husband and I had the opportunity to vist Kuta, Bali October last year and we did venture down to Kuta Beach and I was amazed at how blue, clean and idylic it looked when we strolled down to have a break from the markets and just to cool down. The year before we were in Kuta and when we visited the beach then it was brown, rubbish everywhere and looked like a dump site so we were pleasantly thrilled to see it how it was! So contrary to what others have commented on the beach well down Kuta for cleaning your act up at the seashore even if it was only for that short amount of time! I love the hussle and bussle of Kuta, love the shops, the food and especially the people and we are fortunate enough to be heading there again in March for some R & R!

I have been to many beaches all over the world, and none so aweful as Kuta in January. Trash from the hordes of visitors meets trash from the currents bringing in all the trash that flows from nearby Java up to shore. It's tragic to see Bali go to waste like this.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,537,20>===============  
The increasing number of tourists both domestic and international have made this place one of the most crowded places in Bali, not to mention the awful traffic during rush hours.
For me, personally, I can no longer enjoy the beach. Especially during the rainy season where Kuta beach will transform into a dump place, trash everywhere, either naturally from the trees or ignorant people who litter. I prefer to go to Seminyak, or Mengiat beach in Nusa Dua where it's more peaceful, quiet, and clean.
Don't even come to Kuta beach if you don't like a crowded touristy place, you'll hate it. But if you prefer to blend in with another tourists and don't mind to wander around a crowded place, then Kuta beach is your place to be.

Most tourists to this island will first go to the famed Kuta beach. So did we. Unfortunately, the beach now is in disgusting dirty condition. Waves are ideal for the surfers, but really disappointng for family with kids who want to play in the shallow water and sand. The beach was splashed with waves of garbage of all sorts. And the persistent and nagging peddlers also were annoying. The beach might be good in some ways too, such as having good waves for learning surfing, and being very close to many hotels, shopping streets and the airport.

First time to Bali, was disappointed that the bench so dirty. Rubbish everywhere. Don't recommend to visit this bench during this season. Staying at Jayakarta Bali hotel and resort. Don't recommend to stay here if you are looking for comfortable hotel staying. Very run down in the room, ask for extra bed for my son and they just stacked two mattresses on the floor. Terrible worn out dirty mattress he has to sleep on for 3 nights. Would not recommend to go there with young children. Not really friendly staff if you ask for extra service.

The reason for this review is that I hope the Indonesia Tourism board see the issues with the rubbish in Bali and do something about it.

I've just gotten back from a trip to Bali, (January 2014) and not my first time to Kuta Beach so I know how amazing the beaches in Bali can be. However the storms in January 2014 washed literally tonnes of rubbish onto Kuta, Legian and Seminyak beaches for almost 2 weeks straight!! I know that the Balinese put in a massive effort each day to clean the beaches and I can appreciate that. But the issue of the rubbish ending up in the water in the first place needs to be addressed.

The government of Indonesia need to put some education or systems in place to prevent people from dumping rubbish so that it end up in the waterways and subsequently on the beaches.

It would have been nice to appreciate the beaches more, go swimming, even grab a surfing lesson and get some more amazing photos of the beaches but the rubbish on this trip ruined all that.

Nice long beach. Locals really do try to keep it clear of rubbish much of which is washed up from the sea. We had a lovely chill out afternoon with several Bintang at Rockys and he provided an umbrella and chairs. We were hammered by beach hawkers but we didn't mind as they have to make a living too - although they are very very persistent. Just smile and say no politely and they eventually get the message. Have yet to see a good sunset.

The beach is good ! Nice place to enjoy a good day ! A lot of efforts are being made to keep it clean , but it tends to get dirtier faster than it can be cleaned. As soon as you step foot on the beach you will be swarmed by the locals selling you everything from bracelets to massages to bow and arrows! The best idea is to get a guy selling beer from a hamper for 20K and ask him to give you a chair to relax in the sun or under an umbrella. The beach beds are for hire and price negotiable. It's a good beach once you settle in and the hordes of hawkers stop bothering you .
Enjoy your bintang and chill out.

Kuta Beach is a bit of a dump with the amount of rubbish that washes up from the ocean. One dreads to imagine the level of pollution out in the Bali Sea.

Not so sure about swimming at this beach but hey there were loads of people swimming. Great to watch the sunset if you manage to get some alone time as it tends to be full of aggressive Balinese trying to sell you something.

Kuta beach was a real disappointment for me due to the volume of washed up plastic on the beach. Looking at the pictures I'm sure it was a beautiful place 10 years ago but unfortunately the volume of tourism has not helped to maintain its beauty.

I'm not sure how it can be improved, it's a real shame and highlighted to me the negative impact globalization is having on places of natural beauty.

Perhaps we were just there with rough seas which caused an unusual amount of litter.

Kuta beach is nothing special, especially if you come from the east coast of Queensland Australia. That being said, this year it was a lot cleaner than previous years where you couldn't walk on the beach for the rubbish. We actually saw people swimming this year which is almost a first. Gone were the days 25 years ago when this was a popular beach for swimming and surfing. The locals still haggle you just as much as ever, so if you want a nice beach to relax on, pick somewhere else.

If you are loonging for long stretches of pristine undisturb beaches you came to Bali about 20years too late.
Haveing said that I have seena massive difference (for the better) in the last 4years. During a visit in 2008 you could not have paid me to get in the water rubbish and gunk everywhere.

Now Ive seen beach cleaners picking up rubbish on this trip even went out for a surf and loved it. The tides are strong and if you arent a strong swimmer STAY IN THE FLAGS!!!
Nothing better than finishing a day watching the sun set having a Bintang

Dont judge Bali on Kuta, its busy, messy, busy, hot and full of Australians that treat the place like their personal playground and make you ashamed to come from the same place.

Not suitable for my taste as I like quiet lazy atmosphere for my holidays :)
But I can see why this spot is very popular.. Blue ocean, suitable waves for even beginner surfer, sunset and plane-spotting for aircraft flying from Ngurah Rai Airport.

For public beaches - there are beach chairs that can be rented. But it's located very near to the crowded street. Recommended to stay in hotels with private beach.

Overall - it's a great spot. But it's just not my taste..

I love how the beach is walking distance from the hotel. Loads of surfers. Not so clean but it's okay as chairs are provided. The guys who taught surfing was really friendly, they sit opposite to pizza hut! Really nice guys!

Lots of people selling stuffs like bracelets, clothes, glasses, ice crreams or doing tattoos or massage and nails etc.. Just bargain! Do not pay more than 100000rupiah!!!

The beach itself had constant waves, which made learning to surf easy for beginners. While it definitely is not the cleanest or nicest beach in Bali, there's lots of families and people surfing, so it is quite busy. Be careful where you step as there's often garbage and sharp items on the beach!

If you want a calm-water, clean and calm family beach, this may not be the best option. If you're learning how to surf and want to play sports on the sand, this is a good starting place!

Came back to Kuta on Christmas Eve and saw that the beach and the beach road Jalan Pantai Kuta were crowded with local tourists. Didn't pay further attention as I was busy returning my rental car. Went to the beach the next morning and couldn't believe my eyes. The beach was covered in rubbish, mostly empty plastic snack bags and small beverage containers. There were only a small number of rubbish bins, but they were flowing over. The beach was beeing cleaned while we were there.

The beach was nice and clean. The foreign visitor and the original Balinese are blending. Places to have fun are all over. Its easy to get everything . The Balinese are so friendly. When you stay a while to see the sun set.. its so beautiful. Not only sit and see but you can have dinner while you enjoy it. Its such a great place and view .

Kuta Beach is the only beach I have ever been to where wearing a bathing suit made you the odd one out! Incredibly crowded and more like a market walk than a beach. Hordes of mainly muslim tourists, in large groups and all fully dressed, meant that one lone young couple (her in modest bikini and he in board shorts) were not only a rarity but quickly became a photo opportunity for those not accustomed to seeing such sights at the beach. Group after group stopped to ask if they could pose for photos with them, which the young couple politely obliged, until it became too much and they hurriedly dressed and left. An attractive young japanese tourist, also in a bikini, was subjected to similar "attention" until she too left the beach to find somewhere else to sunbathe in peace.
The beach itself is very dirty with piles of rubbish and debris washed up on the beach. As it had recently rained, we gave it the benefit of the doubt on our first visit, but unfortunately the debris remained daily regardless of the weather.
The many hawkers do add colour and interest to the overall scene and most were happy with a polite "no" and a promise to buy only from them if one's desire for cheap trinkets, sarongs or a massage should happen to change.
The boys manning the day beds and drinks stands were friendly, polite and often quite funny and beers were cheap, cold and quickly replenished as needed.
As a people watching and otherwise interesting experience, Kuta beach is a must do. As a place to enjoy surf, sun and sand - swimming, sunbathing etc, give it a big miss.

Kuta Beach was just opposite to our Kuta Sea View resort. When we saw the reviews and in the map, we saw there was a road between the resort and the beach. Thought it will be bit far away.. But fortunately, the beach was just opposite and was very close. during the breakfast session, we were able to see the beach. We spent quite good time in the beach. The beach was not so clean during our visit and was crowded also. Selling was the key activity in the beach!... the Nusa Dua beach was very good for the water sports.

Besides it being rather dirty. Its a nice place to have a beer and relax, or to people watch. There were plenty of people paddling whatever they had, be it scarfs, tattoos, bracelets and what nots. Beer is 20k rupiah a bottle. You need to rent the chairs and/or beach beads/unbrellas though.

A nice place on a sunny day for a surf, a few Bintang beers on the beach or in a nearby cafe, for sunbathing, a massage or tattoo.

I do not look like a local so it seemed there were a lot of sales people, or people trying to sell me anything they had. Ignoring them made them disappear soon enough.

The beach is huge and there is a lot to do. However, there is also a lot of people there. Its not that bad though and is worth doing. But if your looking for a secluded beach, this is not the place.

I don't think this is a secret, but this is a dirty ,polluted beach and can not understand anyone swimming or surfing here. The beaches in Australia are fabulous, but I don't come to bali for the beach, they have such a beautiful place but some don't respect it regarding pollution and rubbish.

The sunsets are great just not on the beach unless you want to be nagged constantly from people selling stuff. I won't call kuta beach paradise I walked with the kids and was too scared to take our shoes off because of the rubbish.

I stayed at the north end of the Kuta Beach, near the Beachmall and quickly found out that this is the place to watch people learn to surf and if luckly, you might spot the occasional experienced surfers out of the many amateurs that are waiting for the perfect wave. Access to this beach is through the one of many gaps on the newly constructed wall that separates this beach from the busy main Kuta Beach road. I found that it is best to avoid anybody who tries to sell you anything on this beach and just take your time to soak in the sunset (this beach faces west).

If you have small children playing in the water watch out for the bali man( skinny) dresses in black pants, with a black shirt with red trim who is filming children with a hand held black camcorder. We were walking along the beach and he had been filming another little girl, in the water with her family, as we approached to which he turned the cam cord onto my child. Because I stuck my hand in front of her to block the man's shot he then quickly scurried off towards the banks near the trees. I will attempt to get a photo of the man to post and am also reporting this incident.

THis is where everybody goes to sit, swim and surf. Reslut: one hectic place with all good and bad thrown together. Swimming is not really recommended because of the undertow. Surfing is supposed to be good (I am not a surfer). A good place for watching people, while having a beer opr two.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,543,30>===============  
if you can park and get on the beach, you will find it overcrowded and really quite dirty. Once there you are constantly bombarded with someone trying to sell you something. It's a shame because friends tell us it used to be one of the better beaches in Bali but commercialism has set in and there is just too much of everything. Fine sand, warm water. No natural breakwater as in Sanur so be mindful of the swimming conditions

After a trip around the island, we finished in Kuta for some surf but we found many people fighting to rent you a surfboard in a beach with nothing special and a water hightly contaminated untill the point that we didn´t go into the water.
Really not recomended.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,544,20>===============  
Not the best beach in Bali and crowded with the wrong people, sellers of everything made in Bali and beyond. Nail painters, manicurists, masseuse purveyors and the such like.

Not suitable for families or couples.

It is impossible to get any peace and tranquility at a beach that resembles a constantly moving shopping mall with shopkeepers and their wares being hurled at you in an endless line of 'you wanna buy'. Even the deck chairs/lounges are for sale!

As those who like Kuta Beach say "If you don't like it go somewhere else" and that is Seminyak and anywhere north of there. Great advice..........
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,544,40>===============  
easy access to cafe or find a local to teach you how to surf... or just walk around in sunrise or sunset time is nice. I was there for surfing. rent a board from the local, dip myself in the water for a few hrs in the morning avoiding the sun burn. its not the best of the best beautiful's but still do for surfers... if you're looking for a pretty beach to just dip or watch the water... go different one's, there are tans.

There things I liked and disliked about Kuta beach but I would definitely go back.
There are tons of vendors selling random things and services (ie. beer, jewelry, scarves, crossbows, etc.) to tourists but I like the beach is nice for a morning jog or swim! The merchandise is at a premium price of course. The toilets are also not free.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,544,40>===============  
It really is a surfing beach, that was quite clear, good waves but very crowded.
Wouldn't really recommend it for a family or someone wanting to have a leisurely swim or relax, if you want to do that go to Nusa Dua.
Not the cleanest beach around but still nice.

This beach is near to Discovery mall and also big street shopping lanes. Beach is really nice for sunset. Lots of food variety. For street shopping have to bargain a lot. Even if you touch anything they feel like you are interested in it and will be buying it. And if you don't they won't like it. So beware of there behaviour. You can see this everywhere in Bali. (If on budget you can get mini manicure and pedicure for only Aud 10. They start with Aud35 but you can bargain and stick to the price you ask for . They also can do massage, eyebrow shaping by using plucker. For manicure and pedicure they will trim, shape, clean and apply nail paint and draw flowers on it.)

I visited Kuta during one of my official trips... Hence did not have time to spend on beach during the day. However, had some great time after sunset on the beach with friends. It was a relaxing evening with my friends.

We had a surprise visitor from the sea..... a huge turtle which crept up to where we were sitting...

Couldn't spend much time....

During the day, the place is crowded with people with surf boards.

About to go back after only 2 months since we were there. Superb beach with great wives and a cool buzz. A few Bintangs at the Monkey Bar opposite the entrance to Poppies Lane II to cope with the sunset each day is a must. The variety of restaurants is fantastic, Kori Restaurant & Bar on Poppies Lane II was our pick! Later in the evening, enjoy a beer and listen to the resident band at one of the bars in PLII or Legian Street - half the fun is checking them out until you try one you like.

We stayed at the Legian Paradiso Hotel at the northern end of busy Legian Road. We explored the area immediately after checking in at the hotel. There are many noisy pubs at the southern end. There are also many small shops, money changers and eating stalls along the road and around narrow one way alleyways which will link you to Kuta Beach. Beware the unauthorized money changers who have many tricks to swindle you. Watch the zeroes on the IDR you receive...I was almost a victim but saved in the nick of time by my wife's watchful eyes! The southern end of Legian road was the site of a Bali bombing in recent memories where about 200 people were killed but now it is alive and business as usual. The beautiful and long white sandy Kuta Beach is only about 15 minutes walk away. It is reputable for amateur surfing and for observing the alluring Bali sunset. Just sitting on the beach watching the struggling amateur surfers was enough entertainment for us on a cool cloudy afternoon after a heavy rain. The beautiful beach front was walled up high all along Jalan Pantai Kuta and was blocking the beautiful view of the ocean. It was more peaceful and leisurely walking along the beach than by the road. You can also experience a beautiful sunset dinner by visiting nearby Beachwalk Shopping Mall and explore the restaurants that overlook the beach from the top floors. We had ours at a Japanese restaurant which had a fantastic panoramic view of the ocean. Sunset is about 6.30pm, so get up there before 5.30pm to secure a good location, order your food and experience the slow sunset as it disappears below the sea. Watch the charming and changing striking colours of dusk in the sky. It is a view beyond description!

Exchanging money in Bali is a process that travelers need to be wary of. Many of the "official money exchange shops" are crooked. The exchangers will short change your money and you won't even know it. They are very good at it. If the rate is an uneven amount, like 11,490 instead of 11,500, you are going to be shorted almost 100% of the time. If the rate is higher than normal, same thing. If the changer uses 50,000 rupiah notes instead of 100,000 rupiah notes, you're going to be shorted. The changers will also tell you that your $100 US bill is too old and offer you significantly less. If you catch them red handed, they will call it a "commission". Write down exactly how much you should get back in the exchange before approaching the exchanger. Find an honest one and stich with them. If they divert your attention for even a split second, you've been shorted!

best beach in the world. soft sand and interesting place for learn surfing. lot of surf board rentals and they provided for surfing lesson (board for 50K idr/hour and surfing lesson 150 K idr/day).

My first impression is that It's really clean. this is one of the famous beach in Bali. It's attracted a lot of visitor. the shore is long with clean sand. I came here in the afternoon and waited until the sun set. The view were so nice and peaceful. and I also tried a little of broil food with a beer can. this is really an ideal place you shouldn't miss when visiting Bali

Kuta Beach is still great for surfing, but I would go there for a swim since the undercurrents can be dangerous and the beach actually got quite ugly over the yearts. If you want to learn something about the nutrition of people living in Kuta, walk along the beach. Way too much plastic garbage is being washed up. I would not spend time at this beach with my family. Bali has better beaches! In case you need a restroom - make sure you go to a nearby fast food joints....

If you come to Bali and don't experience a Kuta sunset, your doing Bali wrong. Head down about 3-3.30pm, enjoy some bintangs on the beach. If you are staying in Kuta, head to McDonalds and go into the beach from there. Ask for Nana, Malibu or Hamster. These guys can help you out with all your surfing and beverage needs. They run surf lessons and hire out boards. If you want a shoulder massage on the beach, keep an eye out for Sandy. Not only does she do good prices, she has the hands of an angel! There is a toilet block on the beach which costs 20c to use, otherwise, just run across the road to McDonalds. If you are down towards Discovery Mall, ask for Joe's bar. Sunset Is between 6.30-7pm. Try to pick a day that is not too cloudy for best sunsets.

My daughter and I have just returned from Kuta Beach. We spent 9 days there having stayed at the Harris Resort in Kuta Beach.

The beach sand is raked daily by a tractor and the rubbish scooped up and taken away. The locals also take pride by doing their part to keep it clean. Kuta beach can be susceptible to rips but so long as you swim between the flags you are safe. The beach is also patrolled by surf lifesavers during the main daylight hours. If you plan to sit on a banana lounge/deck chair under an umbrella be prepared to pay for it's hire. It appears that sections are managed by different locals who will hire out the lounges and also provide drinks at a fee. When we first enquired about the cost of hiring the lounges we were quoted 150,000 Rupiah ($15 Aus), fortunately for me it was a little quiet and I offered 30,000 Rp ($3 Aus), as that's all I took to the beach with me. After umming and ahhing he agreed. Sitting on the beach on your towel is of course free. Be aware that their is the occasional seller who will offer anything from carvings to massages.....

Kuta beach has great sunsets and taking your camera is worthwhile.

I hope you enjoy it as much as we did!

Cheers,

Paul

been to bali 7 times now over the past 5 years and this time I was over it. prices are to starting to get more expensive and the street sellers are just rude and pushy. sick of getting offered Viagra and drugs off thugs that just sit around and hassle people all day. very lazy individuals get a real job like the rest of the genuine people. many stalls we walked into given stupid prices straight up like 250000 for a singlet. just walked straight out wasn't in the mood to deal with the crap.seems like most of the people there are just scammers. beach isn't nice full of rubbish. make your own mind up but there are a lot better places in the world to travel.

Whether to swim, sit, or walk along a beach is somewhere you want to be. Gets busy when the sun is out, and of an early morning with the walkers and runners. pull up your own piece of space and just enjoy.

I love going for morning walks along the beach. In the late afternoons it turns into a meeting with other travellers,whilst sitting under the shade trees and someCOLD drinks. I like the atmosphere, but it would not be for everyone. Initially it can be overwhelming, and yes ,they always try and sell you something, butthey do go away if you ignore them, after politely telling them "no thanks" a few times. Definitely no massage on the beach for me, because you can't relax, with vendors coming down to your face to sell you something.
I like the variety of people you see there, young ,old, familes, and local families usually gather there on a Sunday, to swim and play soccer on the beach
It is kept relatively clean, however seasonally, huge amounts of rubbish is washed up on the beach daily. You won't see this , unless you are up early, because they are busily cleaning it up at first day light.

This is a surfing beach, there are family people here as well, it is long and wide beach. The sun is hot and be careful to protect, there are plenty of shaded areas where one could get body massage but negotiate the cost by bargaining. There are restaurants and small eateries very close just across the road and shopping malls overlooking the sea where one can go out and enjoy different types of food. A must go place if you are young plenty of night life and bars.

Surprised to see this beach was nice and clean ( read a lot of bad reviews about Kuta beach). It's touristy but that didn't bother me.

Very nice beach, & lovely to enjoy a nice cold drink & a sun lounge but all at a cost & the hawkers can be relentless. Most will leave you be if you say "no thank you", but can be tiring. All a part of the charm of Kuta beach. Great place to hire a board & have a surf, watch the comings & goings, or have a nice massage (when you finally agree on a price for all of the above). I basically figure out what I am prepared to pay & try for less, but do not pay more than I'm prepared to fork out. It's free to use the beach, but a lounge will cost you.

No it's not just a regular beach! you can go there all day and get your personal attendant, drinks, lunch and own private space on the beach! Make sure you are there for the sunset, great view. Well worth a visit and barter with the attendants. If you go down Poppies 2 lane directly across onto the beach look for the Local Bali guy in a white singlet with "Service, Smile, Honestly" on his shirt. Great service and he'll look after you whilst you are there for a small fee, suppling you with drinks all day.

We loved this beach to walk along. Although lots of people along here, it was just lovely. We passed a group making a Balinese Ceremony on the beach which was fascinating. As always watch out when you go in the water, and stay between the flags. There was a large area sectioned off for NO swimming due to strong current and rips. Plenty of life guards available. Some surfers. No worries from the locals selling stuff, they seemed to stay off the beach.

Indonesia is famous for its friendly people. But getting here, hire a bench at the beach in my opinion is not friendly. they set prices very high for local travelers. and in a way that offers bad. they say, we were dangerous, where there are chairs that price. we simply do not bid if not given anything. chinese my face, so I speak Indonesian them reacted differently to us.

We spent 1 night in Kuta and had to visit the beach at Sunset as everyone we knew who had been to Bali said this was the place to come.

Now admittedly we had just come from the Gili Islands (Which are paradise and have beaches from your dreams) but we found the beach crowded, littered and full of hawkers (They aren't overly pushy but after 4 or 5 it does begin to annoy). The fact you can see the arches of a McDonalds and there are so many people make this the Blackpool of Bali (I DO like Blackpool - but it's supposed to be a gritty tatty holiday resort and this isn't supposed to be that tacky).

The sunset was ok - but otherwise we were disappointed. as I say we had come from the Gilis and were used to gorgeous sunsets and beaches but even given that this is a place which seems to be trading on its reputation. At least there was a KFC and a Starbucks to relax in after we left the beach !

The sun and waves are the same as at my first visit, as well as the temperature in the smooth water and the silky feeling of the wind. But that was 1978 and we were just a few down at the beach watching the sunset. Now we're 10-20.000.... But don't miss it.

It was OK, but nothing to compare to Australian beaches. Great group of surf lifesavers. Scenery is really nice. Good views early morning and sunsets. You can take some terrific photos. My memories are spoilt by the number of hawkers, who do not take no for an answer. Refreshing swim on a hot day.

Ok, so lots of people on here complain about the hawkers… Well – if you haven’t notice …they are everywhere in Bali!  This beach has beautiful sunsets – hence the reasons why hundreds of people come down in the evening to watch the sunset and “forget” to take their rubbish with when the leave... Not all Bali’s fault…

Beautiful sunsets to be seen .. Well worth it ... Yes hawkers there but if you are polite and no thanks they leave you in peace .. Just the way it is...

Nice beach but major downfall are the very very many hawkers who try to sell you stuff. Its defenitely NOT a relaxing time but very stressed. Being friendly does not help and telling them to go away also does not help. They even wake you up if you find the time to dose for awhile. This is defenitely the worst experience in the 2 weeks we were there. Everything else is great about Bali and Kuta.

It's not too crowded in the morning, but very crowded in the afternoon. The Kuta beach is quite beautiful, but sadly it's quite dirty, there's trash in the sand everywhere. I don't recommend Kuta beach as place to swim / surf / play water, but it's nice place for watching sunset. This place also good for photography, many subjects can be captured here :)

I just got back from Kuta, Bali and I am already missing the sun, sand and sea. I had a private surfing lesson conducted by Frankie, one of the many surfers conducting lessons and renting out surfboards. He charged a reasonable US$15 for an hour. (I ended up surfing for 2 hours because of the fun so it cost US$30 or Rp300,000.)
Frankie charged a much lower price compared to the surfing schools there. One of the schools charged US$30 for an hour while I got an extra hour for the exact same price. Hence, I would not recommend approaching the surf schools.Its a perfectly competitive market over there, so be sure to check out the prices with a few of the surf instructors before settling down on a comfortable price.
Frankie was a great surf instructor as he patiently guided me the proper techniques (I had zero prior experience to surfing) and before I knew it, I was able to surf comfortably. It was an experience that I would never forget and I would definitely be returning in the near future.
Don't worry about Kuta Beach being dirty, I am certain they must have cleaned up the beach because it was fine when I was there today. The only locals pestering me were those asking me to get tattoos at a cheap price, which I was obviously not keen on.

I like the wave is good for surfing and I dont like watching pople throw away the garbage. Ilke the traditional food, call nasi jenggo. The people around the beach are friendly. I can rent the umbrella and lazy chair so can be at the beach relax. The smile of sea inviting me to swim. If wan to buy or needanything, now many restaurants and mini market are available around the next cross of the beach. One thing that i must be aware that I should make a good bargaining if want tibuy something from pedagang asongan, selling the souvenir around the beach, offering massage etc.

I first set foot on Kuta Beach in 1979, long before any 'high rise' (Oops, no building higher than a coconut tree!) hotels, Kuta Square, Waterbom etc., and whilst the beach hasn't changed, the environment has. Incidentally, Made's Warung was there a few steps from Bemo Corner, before its renovation, and food and service just the same they are now.

I've spent time in Bali every year since 1979, but not being a beach type, have seldom strolled along Kuta Beach, and probably only a total of half a dozen times over those years.

Back then hawkers were thicker on the sand than now, but probably not as aggressive or persistent, and that's a bad thing. They have to make a living, but there are limits to what is acceptable to most tourists. Very few enjoy being badgered.

I'm not a surfer but went down for a stroll and as a consequence of hawker activity didn't spend long there.

Great surf, beautiful sunsets, but the hawkers spoil the experience.

Stayed near Kuta beach. The beach itself is crowded and full of hawkers. But its fun in its own ways. The beach is clean and the waves are fun to swim in. A good place to learn surfing.
Night life around Kuta is vibrant. You can party everyday in a new place. Good for high end shopping as well as road side shopping. Enjoyed our stay here.

Absolutely beautiful beach with stunning views and amazing surf. The vendors and hawkers sat up under the trees offer everything from massages, pedicures, t-shirts, fresh fruit, jewellry etc prices can be negotiated for a real bargain.
The hawkers can become a bit of a pest coming down onto the beach whilst you are trying to relax though and once you talk or pay attention to one, then you can soon find yourself surrounded by half a dozen, all wanting you to buy something from them...a few firm but polite "No's" and they do get the message though...

Wonderful sunsets, great surfing and bodyboarding but the hawkers are painful. Forcefully pushing their wares and offering massage, pedicure and anything else they think you may require. If you sit below the 'high water mark' there seems to be less hassling. Not sure if there is perhaps an unwritten law about hawking below the highwater mark.

As a Brazilian, living in a city - Rio de Janeiro - where surfing is very popular, I've always heard people mentioning Kuta beach: a very famous touristic town, attracting visitors from all over the world to its waves, discotheques and shops. And that is all about it: dirty beach, high waves, very windy, cheap shops, fast food and wild nightlife. Sorry to tell it, but Kuta is for young people, for all those that can endure such ordeal. Not for me, at it least in my present incarnation.

Sunset in Bali is about 6.10pm local time. You MUST see the sunset as the view is too magnificent and unbelievable to be missed!
Beach experience was mediocre. Don't expect white sand and clear blue water. There were a few hiccups like constant harassment from street vendors going around to market their products or services despite already giving a definite "no".
However, I did hear about how great the waves are! Strong current, high waves... Surfers might want to give it a try!

We took part in the baby turtle release on Kuta beach. It was a lot of fun and we learned how they save thousands of endangered turtles by finding the eggs, hatching them then getting tourists to take part in the 'baby turtle race' to release them into the sea. There were over 100 little turtle heads bobbing around in the water. Fee is by donation only

It is such a different experience to visiting our beaches. There is never a dull moment if you are after peace and quiet don't go to kuta as you won't get it.We always go down to the beach in the late afternoon to watch the sun set and have a few drinks The ever friendly Balinese will give you a chair to sit on if you buy their drinks .You can have foot massages eyebrows plucked manicures pedicures backs rubbed anything you feel like while you are there.The surf is OK if you really want to swim .It is a real people watching experience .

A visit to Kuta - the Miami of Indonesia - is incomplete without a visit to the beach which just stretches on and on and seamlessly segues with Legian.

The sand is lovely (though not as much as Nusa Dua or Gili), and the waves are fabulous. Just get in and let the water engulf you. Not clear enough for snorkeling, however.

Great atmosphere. Plenty of Bintang being sold, lots of people surfing (some will even offer to teach you), some people singing with guitars... Good way to pass an entire evening.

Not the place for oldies, looking for a quiet place to relax. Get off the beach if you are after something peaceful. There are nice places opposite including the Kubu Bene Restaurant at the Kuta Playa Hotel. This is a nice place for breakfast with the 80,000 rup. Buffet special including tax and service fee........relaxing, cool, excellant service and great food at a good price. This hotel and restaurant is very popular with asian and europeans tourists. Kuta beach is just too busy for me to be relaxing. Surf schools are very popular in the area so I am thinking that the young just love the place.......here take my seat........I'm off to somewhere quiet.

This beach has some great markets but once you buy from one you will be harrased by multiple other street vendors, but a good place to get a bargain because they all compete with each other. The turtle release programme at the Big turtle is well worth it. We went to the turtle early in the morning to get a token to release a turtle and we got to hold one, absolute great experience.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,553,30>===============  
Kuta is too overpopulated for my tastes. It's great don't get me wrong but constant harrasment to part you with your money by beach vendors for chairs, surfing, massages, fruits, drinks etc is just such a drag when you are trying to relax. The vendors don't leave and are very persistent even after you turn them down. It's a great view and a nice place to learn to surf but if you want to relax head off by bike to some other quiet beaches.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,553,50>===============  
Love Kuta Beach, always so much happening there. It's ace to sit back and relax, drinking some Bintangs or White Water (Smirnoff Ice), watching the world go by. If you are after peace and quiet, do not go to Kuta Beach, you are constantly being approached by the locals trying to sell their wares. I love it. Blues Bar which is opposite the end of Poppies II is a must. Blue is great, and so is his mate/helper Christian. We were fortunate to participate in the release of 300 baby Turtles, this was definitely a highlight. Magnificent sunsets too!!! :D

This is a nice beach but there are so many tourists that you just can't relax here and enjoy yourself as much as Legian beach or Seminyak. There are Australian tourists everywhere, the waves are ok and there are plenty of places to lie down and enjoy a beer or 5. Worth the visit but unless you're into crowds, travel a bit further from the airport to be rewarded with better beaches.

My partner and I loved going to Kuta Beach to watch the sunset and enjoy a cold Bintang. We always went back to the same "bar" area (Bruno :) ) and had him fending off hawkers for us, and telling us a bit about the island and history. Worth a stop to say hello.

Really enjoy sitting in the trees at one of the beach bars watching the world go by. Take a walk to the turtle hatchery, we were lucky enough to be involved in a release of about 300 turtles.
Some of the hawkers can be rude but a polite tidak tirima kasi, will generally see them leave you alone.
The toilets are slowly being brought up to a reasonable standard, not that it really bothers men.
Definitely needs more trees to be planted, it can be a long hot walk to the water.

Kuta beach is average the constant sellers on or near the beach can be annoying, best not to browse just make your way straight to the beach and then you can relax, aerogard is a must for Bali becaiuse of mossies or sandflies.

Great beach, sand isn't as soft as many other beaches around the world, but nice enough. The sunset is great, water did not seem polluted at all like some people say, no rubbish, beach is constantly cleaned by all the beach 'bars' lined up along the beach. Yes there are hawkers galore and i ended up buying alot of things i didn't need but you get that all over Bali no matter where you go. Very relaxing sitting here with an ice cold Bintang for a couple hours.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,554,40>===============  
The water can get rather rough for swimming as Kuta tends to be more of a surfing rather than a swimming beach; but even if the surf is really heavy, you can still cool off in the water (just don't go too far out). Just be warned that you will just need to run the gauntlet of vendors all along the sea wall plus the vendors who walk up and down the beach plus it can get rather hot in the middle of the day if there is no breeze. Also, there are alot of cigarette butts closer to the wall - either from careless vendors or they are remnants of the daily offerings to the gods...

Otherwise, sunset is the best time to get some great pictures as there will be locals flying kites and playing football/soccer all up and down the beach as the tide will be out.

Kuta Beach is lovely but the moment you set foot on the sand you are hassled and it really gets annoying, they never take NO for an answer. My husband and son just wanted to relax and have a Bintang and watch the sunset, but we were hassled continually, one woman actually sat at my feet and refused to move asking me over and over to buy her jewellery, makes you want to get up and leave!!!!!
The sunset on the other hand was amazing and watching the surfers riding the waves makes you feel like you're in Hawaii.

Great atmosphere, so much going on at Kuta main beach. Be ready to be approached by numerous people when you first arrive, offering surf lessons, chairs, "bloody cold beer", artwork, jewellery, ice creams etc etc. Once you make it past the initial wave find a nice spot on the beach or hire a lounger and enjoy.

Great for learning to surf and to have dinner on the beach (with heaps of the locals). Sunsets are great here too

This beach was so awesome that we hit it every single day that we were in Bali.

The water was clear, and the airport at the background somehow seems to blend in well & create this feeling that 'HEY! you are in BALI!' The waves are good fun; swimming out to the sea and getting washed back to shore. Some parts of the beach had a lot of shells and rocks, making it hard and painful to walk.

Tried surfing with lessons for 150,000 rupiah for 2 hours. (Not sure if i got ripped off, but it seems like a good deal to me) IT WAS SO FUN. The waves are not huge and perfect for amateurs like myself. Fell, got up, went out again, and again and again!

The seawater was cold at all times of the day, not really to my liking. But once you're in the water surfing or playing with the waves, it all seems ok!

Best beach in Bali! Been to Sanur & Nusa Dua as well. Sanur is filthy and dirty. Nusa Dua is clean and the beach is nice. However, no waves at all. :)

I have never been fond of the beaches in Bali. There are many places in indonesia to go for the beaches, and Bali is not one. This beach, however, is large and long, which offers a relief from being in a jungle of Australians...

Everyone gravitates toward the beach as the sun begins to set, and there is a certain atmosphere unlike anywhere else - a mix of motorbikes, beach hawkers offering watches, rings, tattoos and pedicures, the sound of the surf, people chatting and relaxing, and all there to watch the sun go golden and vanish.

We enjoyed our stay in Kuta even though we are a retired couple. It's a place for young people and is styled for western tastes with outlets like KFC, Pizza Hut and Macdonalds and plenty of loud western style music.

Lots of people with traffic that is best described as organised chaos. Millions of motor bikes which seems to be the most effective way of moving around. If the roads are clogged then they ride on the footpath.

Pedestrians are right at the end of the food chain. Pavements are awful but it makes life interesting.

Food is relatively cheap and the locals not trying to sell something are friendly.

Watch out for money changers who will often cheat you by various means. It's best to change money at ATM's, banks or the hotel reception. We found the ATM charges quite expensive.

Some of the small shopkeepers will also try to cheat you. Even when using a scanner they will try to overcharge. It's best to have a rough idea of what you should be paying when you reach the check-out counter.

Completely ignore anyone that approaches you in the street offering anything for sale or something that is 'free'. It will invariably cost something and there are plenty of scams on the go.

Taxis are very cheap but establish the rate to be charge before you get under way. Hiring a taxi for the day can be a good way to see the country.

Personal safety is not an issue but just generally being aware and avoiding some of the pitfalls will ensure you have an enjoyable holiday.

I bought a pedicure and all the women saw so they began circling my chair like smiling sharks and it just never ended. It was not fun. I almost lost my temper with one who I begged to just go away. Finally, I had no other choice but to pack up and move down the beach. I ended up with some pretty, cheap gifts for my fellow female employees and a high quality teak wood carved face mask that I need like another hole in the head.

IMPORTANT! I had gone to the beach also to exchange a $100 USD note for rupiah and got cheated. The sign says 1 USD = 10,400 rupiah, but he only gave me 1,004,000, which means I lost $3.60. The only person in Bali who I guarantee won't cheat you is the ATM at the airport or in a large store!

If you want to see what the real Bali looks like, leave Kuta at once!! Okay, it's not exactly that extreme for Kuta and its nearby places do have something to offer.

Kuta Beach was extremely crowded. Probably one of the most crowded beaches I have ever been to in my life. You will find very few people in the water actually for most of them are either sunbathing or chilling out on the sand.

The beach is gently sloped with constant streams of waves coming so you will see lots of amateur surfers. Most experienced and expert surfers are in the southern region of Bali rather than in Kuta Beach.

If you take a long stroll along Kuta Beach, you will find a more deserted area without too many waves which are very suitable for swimming.

Visited the beach every day during my stay and used the paved path for my daily walk/run. Not the best looking beach, but great to see the sun, surf and sand from a different angle. Lots of people out and about. When I first visited Bali in 1994, you couldn't get close to the beach without being hassled and harrassed from the moment you stepped onto the sand. It was nice to visit nearly 20 years later and actually enjoy the moment uninteruped and take some happy snaps.

Compared to the beaches I'm used to in Australia it was a pretty poor beach. During our stay we went for a walk along it a couple of time, there was never many people there and suddenly on the Friday it was PACKED. Watch out for the many people offering to braid your hair, do your nails, give a massage, get you a drink and they will also charge you to sit down on their loungers.

Kuta beach is many things. The beach is very long and even though at times you look along the beach and there are hundreds of people there it didn't have a sense of being crowded. It is a great place to learn surfing - our friends have been taking their 9yr old son there for years to the same surf guy. I am not a 'bar' kinda gal but the little beach bars (friends took us to Sunset Kuta Beach Bar (Taufik is the host)) which consist of red chillers and a bunch of tired plastic chairs, was the place in Bali where I could sit with a cold Bintang, amongst friendly Balinese people, a cool breeze and watch the sunset! Magic, I could highly recommend it! Also, to our amazement they perform human cremations on the same beach - somewhat mind blowing but also as its their culture - totally as it should be.

Kuta Beach is very famous beach in Bali. I always enjoy to walk along the sea side of Kuta Beach. The spot where U can see many people from domestic and abroad under the sun everyday in Kuta Beach. Nice spot to visit, good for fun.....Enjoy it!

A massive beach with hundreds of surfers. Disappointed with lack of beds and umbrellas and cost of them once found. A high number of people selling stuff. I mean there is no relaxation to be held here. Highlight was actually having surfing lessons. Really enjoyable and instructor was amazing as I managed to stand on board and surf my first time. But became disappointing as the sea was NOT clean. Goodness knows what this was. Worth a visit though just to say Iv been to Kuta beach.

My friends and I didn't get a chance to visit Kuta beach until the last day of our holiday but I didn't feel like I had missed out on anything. The beach is very beautiful from a distance but although we got there mid morning, a rubbish truck was still there collecting a tonne of rubbish from the sand. I also noticed a lot of rubbish washing up on shore and that the water was a grey-ish colour rather than a "sea blue". People are constantly approaching you trying to sell you their wares (spray on tattoos, hair threading etc.) and even once you say no thank you, they stand there for a while afterward in the hope that you'll change your mind. I can't imagine you'd get the chance to just relax on this beach like you might on a beach elsewhere.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,557,20>===============  
Lots of people (sunbathing, surfing, walking) - but there's nothing much to do besides that. The water is also greenish, instead of being clear blue. Get ready to be pestered by many peddlers trying to sell you things.

It's always an enjoyable time to visit Kuta beach, you can get your hair set up, massage, shopping for some art, surfing lesson, or just lay back and enjoy the waves. For poor swimmer, don't go too far as the waves are too big. For surfer, enjoy the pipe.

If i were 18 yo and single I think I would love this place. But for people like us on our honeymoon it was too crowded. It is worth a visit to watch people surfing but if you look for peace and tranquility don't stay at Kuta

In busy times the beach can be very crowded and it is fun to watch the surfers when the surf is up in winter. The sand is clean and they make a reasonable attempt to keep it clean.
Watch out for vendors of jewelry and aphrodisiacs (and drugs, I am told), they can be a nuisance. The best approach is to not engage them in any conversation and do not appear to be interested.

Kuta will always be the primary goal if you are in Bali, as Kuta has a nice beach and sand. Kuta is the center and heart
bali city life, you can find public services ranging from transportation, shopping malls, restaurants, hotels, etc with ease here.
Just very unfortunate, cleanliness and safety are not comparable to the high levels of tourists at home and abroad to kuta, so
often found a lot of waste and odor around the beach or other public facilities ...

I think most people come here because its a famous beach, that would be the only reason.
The sand is filthy, dogs running all over, the water is polluted to death, just google kuta beach & you will find tests showing the high faecal content.
There are locals hassling the crap out of you for massages, t shirts and everything else, all junk & all over priced.
Even the taxi drivers that bring you here will jab you!
But there is the surf I suppose, just don't swallow any water or get caught in plastic bags.

Disappointing in severla aspects, not clean at anytime of the day as well night, too much vendors who definitely harasss you as soon you arrived and you are a tourist.

Sand quality is average... definitely better place than there in Bali

The sandy beach and water were clean. Showers are available at a cost for getting rid of the salt water from your body after a swim in the Indian Ocean.

Plenty of vendors selling food and drinks to stay hydrated.

If you want to try your hand a surfing, you can rent a surf board as well as get lessons on using one.

The most annoying aspect of our day at Kuta Beach were the constant nagging of vendors trying to see you souvenirs and massages. I just wanted to enjoy the beach environment. They would go away if you told them you werre not interested in their products or serrvices but they would return a short while later and try again.

It was a day well spent even with the annoying vendors.

It's the beach most tourists go, because of the location. The beach itself is quite nice, with big waves for surfers and clean beach (well, depends when you're going, because I went one time to find lots of trash on the beach).

once you reach kuta beach it is most likely that you will be welcome by massage ladies.they carry tools necessary for their trade on themselves hence you need not worry about the "parlour" which will be any vacant space on the beach where a mat will be spread out and sarong can also be provided if you need one.beware though these ladies will not hesitate to ask for prices even higher than massages places in town. so do bargain.

other traders selling artifacts , souvenirs and fake watches will also try their luck with arrivals at the beach.

overall kuta beach is a very lively place with sunbathers, swimmers and general merry makers lining the beach stretch.

you are not likely to go thirsty due to the hot and humid weather. there is whole set of BARS all along the beach. these are make shift coolers stocked with chilled beverages, most popular being the beers. each BAR has a desidated operating area which the operators clearly adhere to. bar operators also provide for rent sitting facility in case you just want to sit around witaching the crowds go by, watching the sunset (nice but generally clouded hence not the best view).

kuta beach provided a stunning ambience with waves beating on the shore throughout the day and myriads of activities going on all the time.

it is very common for groups to gather in small groups, enjoy the drinks and have simple fun singing away with their friends.

must fo if you are in bali.

The famous, very wide beach of Kuta. The waves are good for body boarding, surfing. Plenty of room to find a spot for sunbathing. Broad views over the ocean, and planes landing. Nice beachwalk at sunset, running and other exercise. There's a lot to buy!

There is hardly any peace to be had on the beach with touts hawking their wares incessantly. Within 20mins of lying on the beach, i was approached by 2 ladies selling bracelets, 1 lady offering massage, 3 guys asking if i wanted temporary tattoos and 2 guys asking if i wanted to learn to surf.
The waters are not clear, but the beach is clean (not litter) and the waves are good. Fun to just jump around in the waves as well as surf. I took up surfing lessons from one of the random guys on the beach and its was way cheaper compared to the official schools.
Hang around till sunset with a beer on the sand. Beautiful sight!

Was looking forward to seeing Kuta, maybe surfing or bodyboarding, but once you get there it's all about fighting of people selling stuff.

Great for surfing but the pestering sellers on the beach made it very annoying to even just to sit down and relax. Go further up Legian or perhaps a more peaceful beach in Bali if you like to just chill by the beach. I sat down for about 45 minutes and got about 10 of them coming to sell me towels or services.

In previous years, my close friend had met a group of people on Kuta beach who soon became her friends. She gave me their number and this started my love for the beach.

Mosh gave me and my boyfriend a whole day one on one Surf lessons, He's a great teacher but after exhausting all my energy on the waves we relaxed on the beach with Okta, Gary and their friends.
They have a spot right by the entrance opposite the Kmart which conveniently has a toilet. Their spot comes complete with seating and a bar at very cheap prices. If you're feeling peckish a meter away is a great noodle bar serving tasty noodles at 50p a bowl!

You aren't hassled as much when with the group and instead the group show you the amazing fruits that this land has to offer you from the lovely ladies on the beach, that I would never of know about.

What made it for me is the music and the sing-a-longs, two guys in the group use to own a music shop and brought their drums and guitars to the beach to serenade us with true Sumatran music (they aslo do requests). This happens every day till sunset where they then move on to DogFoot Clothing Company to carry on the party. Everyone is welcome and everyday there was a new visitor to join the group.

Would happily spent my whole holiday on this beach.

The weather was nice and the sun was bright. the waves was great and great for surfing - or learn to surf.there are many of the Balinese who are willing to teach surfing, but you'll have to bargain cleverly. I got 150k for an hour surfing with an instructor. the beach chairs are also for rent. do the bargain with them or you'll have to pay in high price. they asked for 50k per hour, or 200 all day. I got 100k all day after I bargain with the owner.

Kuta beach is one of the most famous tourist attractions in Bali. It's best for beginner surfers and families. no fee and just walking distance to legian. there are lots of vendors and locals offering surboards for rent ans surfing lessons. it can get very crowded.

lots of hotels around and very near poppies lane, full of cheap guesthouses. its in front of mcdonalds, kfc and rosso's. avoid sundays, there are lots of locals and you won't feel safe leaving your fones, cameras and valuables on the beach.

Just would like to share some bad experience and warning who plan to travel in Kuta beach, Bali. if you walking around the Kuta and Jl. Legian street you'll see the number of money exchange stations a long the street with the vary of exchange rate. I've attracted with the highest rate at 10,xxx Idr./1usd. that is a trap. the keeper will exchange for you in the small bank note 20,000 idr even you will exchange big amount over 1m. idr., So, I keep watched the keeper counted my money and I'd also counted by meself for few times, yes, it correct! but when I was back to my hotel and check again there's 400,000 idr. were missing!! it's like a magic.

Suggest you exchange with the big station and make sure they will give you a big bank note 100,000 idr. that would be easy to count. or someone wanna try to check how they could trick us I suggest you to with your friends, let your friend face to the keeper and you keep recording the vdo behind, keep focus on their hands, and please share the consequences, I'm also wanna know how they can do.

Depending on the season, public crowd, or sea current and it's wind; you will have a different quality of water, sand, and impression over times.

This June-13, I saw a good water, fresh wind smell, and acceptable sand cleanness. While the other times i smell fishy air, murky water with rubbish. Nobody can intervene or cure those situation.

So its no wonder for me the rating was not good enough. However, this beach is thriving as main public destination.

The place is so crowded with people and the traffic is so congested. We wanted to surf but ended up leaving the place in less than 30 minutes. The stalls along the street next to the beach overpriced their goods.

Depending on the time of year you're there, the beach is either mildly crowded or overrun with tourists. Especially considering the fame that has been growing, soon it probably won't matter when you go.

Although Legian is getting more popular (as a result of the crowding), Kuta is still the best beach in Bali for appearances, waves, and meeting people. Many of the more serious surfers head south, but you can still find plenty of cheap rental places in Kuta and some great waves.

The sand is fine and the water clear. The only negatives would be the hawkers that still roam the beach despite the ordinance against this (do NOT leave your belongings unattended while you swim) and the crowds if that's not your thing.

Reasonably clean. Most likely because rubbish are cleared daily in early morning by tractor-rake nicknamed Barber Surf Rake and bulldozer. Also by workers swiping and clearing the ground regularly.

Surfing is a good option on this beach as there are plenty instructors around that can take you on then and there.

Rental of surf boards only 40,000 rupiah per hr. Negotiate first. Cost about 150,000 rupiah for a 2 hrs lesson and they guarantee you can stand while surfing. Food is really cheap if you buy it on the Kuta Beach road. Nasi bungkus or packed rice with fish or chicken cost only 5,000 rupiah. You can get free wifi at Circle K convenience shop. Just buy anything, and theu will give you the password. Be careful with the flags and warnings from lifeguards as sea may be a little dangerous.

The beach is separated with a thick traditional wall from the rest of the bustling and noisy street of Kuta. A good decision since this isolates the beach's natural atmosphere.

This beach is mainly populated with surfers. The rest are people that are just sunbathing, taking pictures, or having tattoos painted on their bodies.

At peak season, the beach is crowded and it may not be convenient to just relax here. Not to mention several peddlers that may annoy you while you are just laying around.

At non-peak season and during the evening, though. The beach is a very nice place to relax and enjoy the scenes. One important thing is that it's quite clean, which enhances the natural atmosphere further. During the night, where few people are about, this is a good place to just enjoy the sea breeze and warm sands under our feet.

Daytime:
Plenty of activities available on the beach e.g. surfing, sunbathing, massage, tattoo services, food and drinks, etc. All comes with a fee.

Kuta beach road is very busy during the day. So, expect delays and noise.

Facilities:
There is a public bathroom but very limited and is located quite at the middle of the Kuta beach stretch.

Transport:
All kinds of transports can be used to reach here - angkot (mini van), motorcycles, cars, taxis, buses. You may rent a bike from you hotel for Rp60k-70k per day (area kuta,legian,seminyak).

View:
Very scenic. Lovely sea breeze. But it tends to get very very hot in the afternoon (especially during summertime).

Sunset:
Come by at 6pm to catch the sunset. it is very lovely indeed for photograph session. At night time, there's nothing to do here except dinner and drink at the beach bar. Other than that, you may spend time on the beach to catch the night breeze with a partner. it is very calming and romantic.

Overall Experience:
Must visit place.

This is very different walk for different people. If this is your first time in Bali/Kuta it can be VERY overwhelming with the locals selling their wares, and for the especially the first time you go there I would recommend learning the words NO and I'm just looking.

You can great some of the best bargains in Bali on the beach walk and some of the worst, and that can be from the same sellers. Never, ever EVER say that it is your first time to Bali you will be ripped off, they will not take it easy on you and try to make as much money out of you as possible in the first transaction. If they are offering items/services at 100,000rp, offer 10,000, if you really want the sale then go up a bit, otherwise walk away, if you are even close to a price they are looking at agreeing to they will follow you, be firm on your price and if you do budge, only do it a little bit.

Another thing is one you start talking to one, another 10 will pop out of nowhere (like ninjas, on the beach), tell them that you will deal with them one at a time, or not at all, and with this be very firm otherwise they will eat you alive.

This sounds like a negative experience, and it can be if you let it, but it can also be great fun, as a number of the sellers in here are a great bunch of people and a lot of fun, with people like Anna Banana & Sexy Hot Dog who will are very cheeky and if you give attitude but all in fun, and Made Jati for selling clothes under the tree who is very very nice as well.

Sitting under the trees, have a nice cold drink (water, soft drink or a bintang), watching the surf and surfers, and just the people walking by while getting a massage, your nails done and doing some bartering was a great experience.

On a visit to Kuta Beach (Legian end) we were approached by a man giving out promotional cards and were told we'd one a $1000 prize. Don't get me wrong, we are neither gullible or stupid but this guy should be up for an Oscar, he was that convincing. Anyway, he took us to an office for a 'presentation' that was suppose to last one hour after which we were guaranteed of receiving our prize. All of this elaborate nonsense was just a cover for some English dudes trying to get $26,000 out of us for a 'holiday club'. We ended up escaping the presentation after an hour but the driver outside told us that people outside had up- to 3 hours of their holiday wasted and also that people who hard parted with their money had not got the holidays they had booked. It was called ABSOLUTE WORLD - so RUN AWAY if you are approached!

I think everyone who goes to Bali, at some point might visit Kuta beach!
However, beware that Kuta beach is not that amazing compared to other beaches on Bali.
I found Kuta beach to be over crowded, polluted and the hawkers to be extremely push.
Has the day goes on and you are sitting on the beach, you start to see plastic bottles, bags and other rubbish starting to be washed up on the beach, and cleaners trying there best to maintain a clean beach, at times it is like they a fighting a losing battle! This can be seen first thing in the morning.

You can learn to surf at the beach, and the tides did not appear to be as strong as other places in Bali.

However, it is ideally placed for the tourist industry due to Kuta square and the bars being nearby.

The beach is just a beach. Not much. A lot of people, not really clean. Definitely not for family with young kids as the wave is strong (especially the undercurrent) and the slope is steep.
Many surfers surfing near the shore. Many are very irresponsible as they don't wear the strap. I had a very bad experience as one of the surf boards (long and heavy one) got washed ashore and hit my wife's foot. It lifted her toe nail and filled the gap with sands. I had two kids near by. Imagine if the board had hit the kids. When I looked around, I saw a lot of guys not using the strap.
The dude was a local surfer who, according to the nearby merchant, was a instructor at a nearby surfing school. He said sorry but did not seem like he meant it. He does not seem to have any concept of safety but he had the gull to tell me that it was my wife's fault that she did not get out of the way. He went on and told us to get out of his beach. He ran away and we ended up at Bali Medical Center for toe nail extraction.
So, all in all, not a good beach as you can see this kind of beach everywhere, a lot of mixed kind of people, good ones as well as very ignorant ones. So there is a risk.

Kuta beach unbearably polluted, seriously overcrowded, unattractive, bothersome, annoying and not even a good beach to start with. It is the only place in Bali with sewage rinning in the drains to the water. It smells.

Massage girls and pedicurists negotiating with working class Aussie families for dabbling in their mediocre attempt at cross cultural exchange that oh too often results in flights home full of hair braids, love bracelets and overly oiled and tanned bloated bodies.

Surfer boys and bar girls compete for visual space spread out on their towels like wilting flowers in the sun, recovering from their dalliances the night before.

And all of this and much more being observed with amazement and bewilderment by an endless stream of Islamic Javanese visitors whose worst fears of the behaviour of infidels are confirmed by the silent concession of zero communication.

Most sadly, watched by the Balinese, so contradictorily obsessed with their rituals and cleansings to ensure the manna from heaven of the tourist dollar keeps falling.

All problems washed away by the high tide and the endless stream of cheap labour deployed to maintain the fantasy of a clean beach each morning, whilst underlying infrastructural issues go unaddressed. That raw sewage.

Kuta Beach is one of the saddest, most appalling ,most culturally fascinating places I yet visited in my travelling life.

As a cross cultural practitioner I love it for the lessons it teaches, as an environmentalist and indonesianist I loath it for the polluted cess pool it has become.

Kuta Beach is everything that is good and bad about Bali. Bali’s success is its failing. Packed with people. Thronged with thronged Ozzies. Inundated with the indulgent and ignorant from all over the world.
The beach itself is touted as one f the world’s most beautiful. I cannot see it. Certainly as the sun sets, you can appreciate a lovely sunset over distant Java. But make sure you focus on the skies and not on the rubbish and the ubiquitous sellers of everything from a massage to fake sun cream to cold drinks.
Bordered by typically decrepit infrastructure, narrow lanes and chaotic traffic, the place certainly has a feel of the exotic. Too much of it, perhaps. You fight your way to the beach expecting to be alone (relatively) and relaxing on a pristine beach.
You aren’t. And you are disappointed. Kuta Beach may be legendary, but it is legendary for the wrong reasons. Peace, quiet, beauty: these are not part of the legend.

We stayed near Kuta beach in Hotel Dewi Sri. I will like to warn travellers about following
1. Money Changers.. Please be very careful about private money changers who are every where
on streets. They will count the money exchanged infront of you then they will disract your attention by saying they dont have change while you are busy taking out your wallet.. few notes will be taken out from your exchanged money. This happened twice while we were exchanging dollars.We found that at least 10-20 dollars worth of IDR was missing from our excahnged money.
Once we found out the fraud they became very aggressive and told us to leave their place imediately. Please count the money very carefully when you are leaving the shop after you have exchanged. Dont ever ask /trust them to count for you.
2 Private Taxi operators. Please do not trust private taxi operators. They will promise you something but will never turn out . Their prices are hiked up at least 2-3 times. We made a deal for taxi for 3 days but the driver came only for two days when we wanted to go to airport he ditched us giving some vague excuse. I tried another one for 100 000 IDR he also didnt turn up nor he informed he was not coming. Finally I took Blue taxi to Airport for 35000 IDr which was 1/3 the price what private taxis were asking.
Please use Blue Taxis they are more reliable and trust worthy

Bali is a fascinating place. Mostly for what it has lost. In ten years it has become noisy, congested, traffic ridden and garishly touristy. Well in the south at least.
Kuta beach is beautiful, with great waves for messing about in. But it is over populated with tourists and hawkers. it feels like the 'safe'; bus from airport, week in hotel, bus to airport, sort of place. So, go on, take a risk and explore the rest of the island north of Ubud. I will next time.

The beach itself is nice and I think is the best place is you want to sunbathe if you're staying in Kuta. However, I only spent about 30 minutes at this beach because the weather is super hot and is easily to get sunburn if I stay any 15 minutes longer. If you're staying nearby Jalan Pantai Kuta or Legian Street, you can choose to walk to the beach without taking a cab.

We visited this beach while staying at the Grand Mirage. It is a nice beach overlooking the water. There is plenty to do here like swimming, yoga, snorkeling and renting other sports. It is more expensive to rent from the resorts but it might also be safer. You get what you pay for. There are locals selling trinkets on the beach which is fun to look at their wares. They will not come onto the hotel properties tho. Which is good to if you do not want to be bothered. There is a concrete boardwalk that goes down the beach which is always fun. Overall not a bad beach. Cleaning is up to the individual resorts so cleanliness can be spoty.

Kuta beach is nice if you are just sitting on the sand. However, the water is filthy. There is just rubbish everywhere in the water. The water temperature is beautiful but I was turned off by the waste.

Be prepared to be bothered if you do just sit on the sand as well. Every five minutes we had someone ask us if we wanted to Learn how to swim, surf, boogie board, if we wanted ice cream etc.

Kuta beach is definitely worth a visit but for a more relaxing experience stay by the pool.

Kuta beach is the center of activity in Bali. The beach is lively but too crowded. They have surfing schools and other water sports there. in the background to the south of the beach you can see the runway of Nghura Rai International airport on reclaimed land.
For me the beach was disappointing but across the road from the beach are many lively bars, restaurants and food stalls serving local Indonesian seafood and more.

Kuta could be a dirty noisy party town found anywhere in the world. There is nothing authenticly Balinese about it. The streets are lined with hawkers who ruin your experience and even if you politely ignore them they will insult you when you pass. It's impossible to walk around without the fear of being mowed down by scooters or your husband being harassed for a massage. The beach is far from spectacular. We can't wait to leave and find somewhere quieter and more authentic and genuine. If you're just looking for party central and don't mind what I mentioned above you might like it but I found it very disappointing.

I went here about a week ago. The beach was very crowded and is full of hawkers trying to sell stuff.
It's nice to take in the scenery though but watch out if you're swimming especially with kids because the waves get pretty big and I've heard the current gets very strong- I didn't risk swimming there.
I've heard the sunset is very beautiful which I regret seeing so If you go I recommend staying for the sunset. If you're after a very pretty beach try padangpadang.

I stayed at sanur recently. And visited Kuta beach.Spent about an hour there. I liked it. Among all the beaches that I've seen in bali, I think Kuta is the best. However, It's also the messiest, and most crowded. Full of hawkers selling their stuff.
But I enjoyed the whole carnival like atmosphere. There were loads of younger tourists lounging about the beach, swimming and some were surfing. It's an exciting beach, with loads of things to do. And at night meander through the streets of Kuta township, sampling all it's delights.
If I was a younger tourist, yes, I would definately stay at Kuta.
But since I'm travelling with young children and an elderly parent,Sanur was the better choice.

First time I visit it, it was still clean and beautiful. That was 20 years ago. Now it's so crowded and there are sometimes garbage here and there. Sometimes u can find dead fish too.

Kuta Beach is extremely dirty. One can't enjoy swimming unless one would like to dance with all sorts of garbage, from plastic to less pleasant. The prices are high for drinks.
If one wants to enjoy the surf, ok, go for it. The same for the sunset, loads of people are meeting up every evening for the spectacle.

Kuta beach is very disappointing! It's littered with rubbish which doesn't get cleared so it ends up in the sea making it impossible to go in. The sand is black & there isn't much to do or eat. The only positive comment I can say is that the surfing is fun to watch! If you are coming to Kuta for the night life then I strongly suggest that you find an amazing 4* hotel with a beautiful pool as you'll be spending most of your days there. In general the Kuta & Legion area & beach have been spoilt by tourists & the locals who have given up on keeping the place clean.

Kuta beach is the kind of place that should not exist. It's a mess! Architecture is the worst, with buildings, fast foods and shopping malls along the beach. Wherever you walk, every meter you are offered massage, taxi, marijuana and even "ladies" ! It is not Balinese anymore, neither international (or Australian as some may say..) : it is just a terrible place that one should avoid ! Except if you want to see how wrong development can be...

It's even sadder because it could (should) be beautiful...

We had also a bad experience while changing money. First of all it is very difficult to see who is authorized and who is not. All say they are. In our case there was no problem with commision, The amount was right, But here to there where several stacks of money. And the scam happened when the changer gathered all the bills in one stack. While gathering he managed to let drop a fair amount (about 25%) in a drawer behind the desk.

So try to change with legal shops, bright neon signs, you have to fill in a note.
Never let them touch the money after you have counted, if they touch? Count again or better take your money and go somewhere else.

Worst beach i've ever visited, with the dirtiest ever toilet/shower, and to top it all off, waaaayyy too many trash and hawkers. Nothing is right. This was my first time visiting Kuta beach. If you want a better experience, please, by all means, get a hotel with private beach. Save yourself the suffering of being "ambushed" by very persistent hawkers, whom had the nerve to become angry when you lose your temper. The whole experience of going to kuta beach was a nightmare. The toilet, ohhhhh dear God! So dirty, so dark, so disgusting, so....eeewwww....to think of it makes me cringe. And you have to pay Rp2000,- for using it?
Not again.
Just, noooo....stay away from this awful beach. Go to Nusa Dua. Go to a private beach somewhere.

We arrived on Jan 3, 2013 and the first morning I was shocked as to the amount of trash not only on the beach but floating around in the water and waves. Seems like they might dump their trash in the ocean only to get it back. We are talking lots of wrappers and trash.

We went there in December 2012. We found the beach clean and beautiful. Nice place to watch sunset and suntanning. The wave are strong for surfing. Saw people playing fireworks at night. Good to take a stroll along the beach to enjoy the sea breeze.

First off, i arrived after midnight, so obviously the taxis at the airport are going to take advantage of you.

When i woke up on my first morning in Kuta and made my way down to the beach, I discovered a trash-filled beach at 8am. Workers were hurrying to sweep up the heaps of plastic wrappers strewn across the sand, complete with a bulldozer and rakes. But it was too little, too late. Apparently, there is good beginner surfing for the tourists here. Actually, there are tons of people on the beaches and they are constantly hassling you and even touching you to get you to buy their merch/crap. One beautiful sunny day, i waled out to the beach, and it didnt even seem too bad, I took a nap on the beach and tried to enjoy the would-be yellow sand and blue waters. I took a nap, then awoke to old men taking photos of me and coming up to talk to me until I felt uncomfortable and left.

There are much nicer beaches anywhere else in Bali. Rent a scooter and get out for the day. I liked the fact that I could get to know people in town and then leave when I wanted. I only stayed in Kuta for the night life and a little bit of fun- which there is a lot of.

Kuta beach is in fact a continuous stretch that covers many areas including Legian, Seminyak and stretching down towards the airport it is huge.

The beach has a row of sun loungers along its length almost each hawked out by a beach seller. The prices vary considerably so please bear in mind you don't want to pay more than 1-2 dollars for a chair.

The beach has many people willing to teach you to surf. Again prices vary from just under

100,000IRP to 500,000IRP from what i was quoted for 2 people with an instructor and use of the boards after the lesson of 1-2 hours.

he boards are likely to be foam which will give you board rash on any exposed skin, and blisters on your thumb pads where you grip. Wear a wet suit provided by the surf provider unless your using a fibreglass board. These burns can be very uncomfortable.

The waves are constant and perfect for beginners. The training is enough to get you up and running so as you can stand and ride a wave into the beach.

Sand is soft but there is rubbish around although i did see a team of people collecting rubbish in the day. The water is ok to swim in but of course the waves makes it little more difficult. Would advise young kids be kept in the very shallow entrance.

Kuta Beach is undoubtedly the most famous and most visited beach of Bali. Kuta attracts visitor from around the world, and can be very much enjoyed for long beach walks, amateur surfing and other beach activities. Though some of the females have been regularly chased by the 'Kuta Cowboys', but they can be easily ignored if someone is not interested. On the whole, Kuta provides a good beach experience for every visitor and atleast once a visit whosoever travels to Bali..!!!!

Every time i visit Bali, even for a day trip, i will always visit this famous beach.. i believe everybody who ever visit Bali have heard this beach and might visit it at least once during their stay. Its a huge beach, i enjoy having a long walk on it, beautiful cold water, it's worth it even for a short dip in, the wave is heaven not only for surf beginner but also for the pro. The beach is always clean as all the people who help themselves to earn a living there have a broom handy with them. The seller is everywhere but they are quite polite and not pushy as long as you behave yourself. Say no thank you is always better than ignoring them. They earning a living, just like everybody. Food are easy, western or local, drinks too, soft drink or the famous 'Bintang' beer. If you buy drinks from the vendor they will allow you to use the chair for free. But I enjoy just sitting on the beach and feel the sand whilst watching the surfer enjoying themselves. Sunset is always amazing when it's not cloudy.. What else can i say, it's the beach!! with a 'must' see sign on it..

The sunset wasn't spectacular at that time due to the huge clouds covering the island, but we had Bintang Bali and Bali Hai in hand so it was good enough.

Its always lovely to have your massage done on the beach by the sea under the beautiful blue sky.Done that in many beach holidays in countries like Philippines, Thailand.
Its always better price getting a massage from the freelancers walking around on the beach then in Spas or proper massage places.
But in Kuta beach they are rip off.I found great spas for massage for less than what I paid on the beach and with professional masseuse!

Besides that Watching Sunset is beautiful and boogie board is fun.

Kuta Beach is famous for its sunsets for good reason. Get a good spot, kick back and watch the show. As for the beach itself it's nothing special, and a fair but if rubbish in the water. If you want crystal clear beaches and good surf head towards Nusa Dua. Kuta Beach sunset is a must though.

When my first visit to Bali i love this Kuta beach, but since i found there's a lot of beauctiful beaches around Bali iam coming here for only people watch and see the sunset nothing more, this beach is now dirty, bottles, plastics floating in the water, the only reason why people keep coming here because its close to main attractions at the center of Kuta :D

To spend a couple of hours on Kuta Beach is a must! Hire 2 beach lounges complete with umbrella & table for 100 000r ($10aus) for 2 hours & your set. Order a cold drink or maybe an ice cream then lay back & relax OR if your like me get your nails done for 60 000r ($6aus) & do some shopping from the comfort of your beach lounge. Surfboards can be hired for as little as 50 000r ($5) for an hour & you can also get lessons. There is life savers on duty with flagged areas for swimming. you do get hassled a bit more on the beach, if your not interested say nothing & look the other way they will get the hint. It's a genuine Bali experience & it is very much like the old Bali of 20 years ago.

My wife and I have lived and worked in Indonesia for 27 years. We have worked in Bali too and lived there the last of the 27. In the 80s Kuta was not so crowded. I jogged on that beach with many others at around dawn. That beach in the very morning is one of the most beautiful things in Bali. Some people's life-styles preclude this treat! In April this year I've noted some changes. Even more crazy construction on the beach front in places.

Jalan Poppies I (or Poppies Lane One) is where the whole tourist thing began at Kuta. there are classic places to eat on that lane that vary in price range but all three that I'm going to mention here are simply delightful... The Tree House restaurant (There used to be a huge tree there). It's family run and they do a first class job. The menu has a great combination of Western & Indonesian choices. Further up the lane is the Bamboo Corner, it's cheaper, the food is not quite as excellent as the Tree House, but not bad and cheaper. This place is right next door to TJ's Tex Mex restaurant. TJ's is gorgeous. I have never seen such a merge of tropical ambience with art and delicious food. It is a place for special occasions, meetings...simply timeless. It is not a cheap place to eat. But is a must really. Along the lane there are many othe rplaces. Some look quite inviting and no doubt are but when in Bali I frequent these three since I have from the mid 80s. They don't disappoint.

Back to the beach at Kuta. During the rainy season..around September - late April (It varies alot sometimes) the water is so polluted from all the garbage washed down by nearby streams..better to go inland to Ubud if you're in bali at that time of the year. The beach would make you cry. But during the dry season, it's wonderful. Originally, I went there for the excellent and challenging surf. I used to spend all day out there....I came in when I was hungry rather than cold!! That's the beauty of it! No more. too old for that. It's kept quiet, but no small number of people have drown in those potentially treacherous waters. Huge surf and rip tides require trained common sense.

"Kuta works great to keep people away from the great parts of Bali. Thanks Kuta." Could not be more true! But there are great aspects of Kuta, believe me. Just takes a little work to discover them, but they are there.

If you want to try perfect Javanese-Indonesian food..(Even the people who run TJs order stuff from there!) go to the very popular "Warung Nikmat" Means "Cafe Pleasure"...as in gastronomic) If you are interested in a vast selection of traditional foods..at a sensational price, this is for you. It's on Jalan Bakungsari right next to the Bakungsari Hotel. It is an absolute must!

Enjoy Kuta (not the ever present seedy junk that has always been there) ...don't throw the baby out with the dishwater.

It's the place to learn surfing, children play sand castle n chasing wave (have eye on them! The waves can suddenly come in hard in the middle of calm rolls). You can sit n lay back reading books under the tree or tanned ur skin under the sun.

On ur firsy arrival, The folks with lots to offer from hair knitting, manicure, pedicure, massage, body scrub, temporary tattoes, various hand made bracelets, necklace, jewelry box, ice cream, u name it; will try their best to sell u their stuff, they won't take NO for answer easily.

If u wish to have those spa treament on the beach, say little, be direct but nice, don't give too much smiles and have them in package. Say 300k I want all (hair knitting, meni&pedicure, massage + scrub + temporary tatto). Take it or leave it - say it nicely.

The following day when they see u around wearing hair with plenty accesories from previous treatment + tatto, they will say hi but they will leave u aalone to enjoy the beach.

My first impression of Bali when I arrived was un-welcoming when I touched down. Airport was a mass and we had to walk about 7 minutes to get a taxi carting your luggage don't forget (they don't use meters and you are always robbed by them). The resort was quite old ( to be polite ) and many shops were of typical small size and selling the same cheap low quality stuff. The beach is walled by tedious unpleasant brick walls and you feel like being in prison. Toutors were everywhere and they did annoyed us as we couldn't have any peace at all.

Bali has a big problem with power shortage and almost every nite we had power cuts in the middle of the dinner. Food in Bali is below standard and for those who are into proper quality food. It is a big disappointment. We rechon that Kuta is suitable for backpackers and for the young as it does provide all the very basic needs. Be aware of poor hygience in Bali and they take cockroaches and mosquitoes granted as their companion. This is a place not for the quality sought after holiday makers.

The sand is not the original state (they brought it from Jimbaran?) so it looks quite nice. Not as much hassle as it was a few years back too. It has a lovely view for sunset though. I normally go to other parts of the beach i.e. Legian, Seminyak for better hang out place.

I went to Bali recently and spend few days shopping at Kuta and enjoyed ourselves very much. However, there is something to warn all tourist about... its the MONEY CHANGER. There are plenty of money changers in Kuta. Every few shops that you walk pass, there bound to be 1 or 2.

This is what we found out after visiting 3 money changers in a row :
(First 2 outlets my friend went alone while i was busy shopping next door. The 3rd one i went with her)

1) Most money changers claimed to be AUTHORISED money changer (stated on their board) but in actual fact, they are not authorised.

2) After conversion, they actually takes a 10% commission which they DELIBERATELY not tell you. They will punch in an amount on the calculator to get you to agree which is an amount BEFORE deducting the commission.

They will count the money infront of you twice but in actual fact, the total amount given to you is not the same amount punched in the calculator which you agreed. Which i believe this will have many tourists fooled by trusting that they will give you the amount as per stated on the calculator.

3) They all give out bills/ notes in small denominations mostly in 20,000 ruppiah so that it involves a lot of counting of the bills/notes with the aim to confuse you.

4) They place the 20,000 ruppiah bills in stacks of 5s and ask you to count as well. Each time you have completed counting & verifying a stack of 5, you place it back on the table and proceed to count the next stack. (This process is to distract you so that you focus on verifying each stack of 5 instead of counting & verifying on the total amount)

But if you attempted to take all the bills and count in 1 go, you will notice that the amount does not come to the amount agreed shown on the calculator. They will give u slight **annoying look** like as if you had counted wrongly. Then they take the money and counted infront of you again in stack of 5 and ask u to verify again (in stack of 5, stack by stack).

The above process can repeat a few times. They are persistant to **show you** that you are wrong.

My friend is an accountant and she is a very cautious person. My friend refused to change since when she recounted the TOTAL no. of all bills in 1 go every time, the amount did not come up to the same as shown on the calculator. In fact, it was far from that.

After the 4th or 5th rounds of recounting, then only she was told there is 10% commission since my friend refused to accept when the amount doesnt tally.

5) They cheat BEYOND 10% Commission

My friend got me along to help her when visiting the 3rd money changer. We were more alert now.

We asked 1st repeatedly 4 times if there is a 10% commission. The guy said no. So we proceeded to the next step. Same tricks as the others (as mentioned above). So being smarter this time,
i) we refused to count the stacks of 5 (though they kept insistingg that we do). Instead, after they placed in stack of 5s, I gathered all the bills in 1 go and counted the number of bills all in 1 go. While i did the counting, my friend watched closely.

True enough was far from the amount shown on the calculator.

ii) As I had mentioned, they will give u an annoyed look (to make u think u are wrong). So I recounted again the 2nd time, the 3rd time and 4th. It was far from the amount shown on the calculator.

After a few re-counts, they realised we are super cautious and that they cannot fool us, especially we have 1 counter (me) and 1 person to watch (my friend). So finally he punched in a different amount on the calculator to show us this is the "actual" amount he is actually giving us (which has deducted 10% commission).

Now this is getting more interesting because even the "actual" amount (incorporated the 10% commission) differs greatly FAR from the number of bills he had given us.

So we left.

Then as I bumped into to a police man (being a Malaysian, i could speak malay which is 75% close to indonesian language) and told him the money changers here all attempted to cheat. He pointed to me a proper genuinely licensed/ authorised money changer where we could have our money changed without being cheated.

We did and was glad that the 4th one (recommended by the police man) was genuine. We were given mostly in 100,000 rupiah bills and there wasn't such thing as 10% commission nor stacking up in bills of 5 or so.

When we relate the incident to this money changer, she told us to be careful as the unlicensed ones deliberately give in small denominations of 20,000 ruppiah bills in their attempt to confuse the customers when counting.

HOW TO TELL IF A MONEY CHANGER IS GENUINE ?

* Most GENUINE Licensed Money Changers occupy the entire shop (instead of a small wooden booth inside a shop)

* There are a few genuine licensed money changer which doesn't have a shop but a booth but usually its a proper booth with neon light sign board (light box) on top.

Apart from the cheating money changers and the driver that took us to tourists restaurants (when we repeated requested for non-tourist local indonesian restaurants), our shopping experience had been very pleasant as the Balinese are generally very polite.

By the way, it is also recommended to take metred taxi as opposed to private car to the airport (though your hotel reception may tell you its the same price). It cost us 60% cheaper than the private car.

Unfortunately, even though the local sellers keep their own spot clean, the same cant be said for the whole beach. In March the winds and tides bring in so much rubbish that everyone just carelessly throws about that it is impossible to go for a swim without endangering your health! We were really dissapointed...

Love this place! Met heaps of great people. If your a surfer I guarantee you will love the surf here on a good day. Strong swimmers only go in because I even got flung around like a rag doll...after considering that I was a decent swimmer. They have bars along the beach where you can meet the locals and have a beer with them also. They also have a awesome Indonesian coffee that the locals only drink which I think is a must. Europeans would know the Turkish style (mud coffee) that they have there. I found the locals selling these close to the airport side of the beach after many runs along it. It retails at about 20 cents AUD$. That compared to Gloria Jeans (best and only decent coffee in Bali by the way) which is at the standard $4 AUD...this is definitely a steal with the nice location of the beach/company of the locals. Overall love this beach and will be back again! Lovely people !

My wife and I stayed in Kuta for a few nights and spent our time on the beach for the sun and the surfing. The waves and current were very strong which made it kind of hard to get to the waves. The beach was covered with plastic trash and palm tree debris which was a little disappointing. There are a lot of locals selling thing that can be very annoying. Lastly, we met a local guy that gave us surfing lessons and a board for the day for a good price. We had fun but are not sure if we would come back again.

We have visited Bali in many occasions, since I worked nearby. Saying this, we are not either the typical beach people, because we get plenty of sun and sand in another more desert island. But Bali is a comfortable place to be, good food and relaxed atmosphere. If you are not in Kuta Beach. Here you will be asked of "maaaassssaaaage" twenty times every 100 meters on the area of Kuta Square / Hard Rock Cafe. The best way to say politely thank you but no thank you is to say hello in Indonesian or Balinese and you will get a smile back. We like to exercise, so we went to the beach just before sunrise (at 05.30 AM or so) and walked along the beach for an hour and half and back same length. If you do it at sunrise, you will have Kuta Beach at its most beautiful and chilled, with families strolling, people walking their dogs, and the pleasant ambience we like with Bali. Of course you will garbage, but also some reasonable attempts to clean it every morning. Do your share and bring your garbage back to the nearest bin... :)

Wow, I don't understand why people want to go here when they could go somewhere actually beautiful, like Jimbaran, Sanur or the Northern beaches that are more off the beaten path. My husband and I couldn't sit on the beach for even a minute without being hassled. In Bali you expect to be harassed, but it's at the worst along this strip of beach. When you're on your honeymoon, it is the last kind of place you want to be. Don't buy into the hype.

When I first saw Kuta beach I thought in sorrow that this is not what I was thinking as a tropical beach in Bali...
There were rubbish in the water and of course on the beach. It was hard to walk in because of the broken corals.The annoying locals that were selling souvenirs made me run away...
Although I'm a sea lover, I prefered the clean water of the pool this time !

Kuta, just outside Denpasar, the the place where young people, mainly from Perth in Western Australia go to lose their virginity, money, inhibitions (If they had any) and, for varying spells, their liberty. A superb place to stay away from. The beach is crawling with local people (many of them allegedly plain clothes police looking for an easy arrest) touting small amounts of marijuana. Bars function 24 hours a day, behaviour is appalling. Do'nt go within 50 yards of any of the (hundreds) of tattoo establishments since AIDS has been contracted from 'dirty needles'. In fact, if you must go to Bali, stay at the "Posh pubs" run mainly by the Establishment. They are safe, but monsterously expensive.

Just spent a month staying with wife's relatives in Denpasar; 22nd visit since backpacker days of 1973. Exchange rate is good for Aussies these days but prices (except for taxis) have more than kept pace, particularly the three/four-star hotels. But the main problem is the severely stretched infrastructure (electricity/sewerage/water and above all, the roads) and rampant overdevelopment of the Kuta/Legian/Seminyak coastline. Every former leafy footpath through coconut groves is now chock full of small shops, with an endless cacophony of motorbikes as the dominant soundscape.

Upmarket tourists can still get away from it all (or most of it) in the hills of Ubud or exclusive enclaves like Nusa Dua, or the better-located villas, but the mass-market tourist experience in the South Bali area is nowadays more to be endured than enjoyed.

This beach is one of the most popular in Bali. A great spot to enjoy the sunsets, but also very busy with many tourists and hawkers. Caution is needed here as there are strong rips.You have the opportunity to learn to surf here with local companies and there are guys on the beach hiring out boards as well. The quality can be a bit dodgy so check carefully before hiring.

Spent a couple of days at Kuta after spending time at a beautiful resort in Seminyak.The beach at Kuta was littered with spent fireworks (after New Year's celebrations),lots of plastic bags,bottles and general rubbish. Walking through the streets and markets we were constantly harrassed to buy poorly made souvenirs/clothing starting price higher than equivalent products in Perth. I have resisted the urge to travel to Bali in the past and finally decided to go and see the attraction. Do not know why you would go to a place with very poor infrastructure,poor sanitation and health-care. We had money stolen from wallet whilst on a tour (White water rafting), while we were swimming. With the high threat of terroism,petty theft, bali belly and mosquito borne disease- as they say; reconsider your need to visit Bali! (and specifically Kuta)!

I will start by saying that it depends what you consider great. If you go for a holiday to relax and enjoying firstly the nature and culture or you just want a place to have pubs and drinks and also..drugs everywhere...cos this is Bali and especially Kuta !

I was shocked by the number of foreigners in Kuta, mainly youngsters having fun, drinking way to much, going to clubs to dance ...Drugs are being sold openly in the streets with the police not saying anything, I also understood prostitution is a great seller of the place.

I didnt like Bali frankly because of all the hustle bustle, first the manic traffic, the roads too small, the nature not really visibile and then this, I wdnt recommend this for a family trip or people that prefer a quiet, relaxing trip to a country...

I used to love kuta once. Last time our tour guide bet to us if we found beggars more than 4 in BALI, she would give us gift. Right now. You may see beggars more than 10 in kUta-legian. you may see old lady with poor child sleeping on boardwalk near hard rock hotel. The worst happened , i sat on the kuta beach at 11 pm. Suddenly one guy with guitar (pengamen) asking the money!!! Local govt. Must take action now if not, Kuta is getting the most avoided place for tourists

Kuta beach is the least popular beach in Bali for myself friends and family

The area seems overcrowded noisy and dirty
There are as in other beach areas of Bali plenty of restaurants and hotels where you can stop for a drink or meal there is also Mcdonalds restaurant

Poppies lane 1 is one of the streets leading from the beach and this lane is great for shopping and leads you to Poppies lane 2

Again there are plenty of sellers on this beach but somehow seem a little more aggressive than in other beach areas

Kuta/legian area is one of the most overrated areas I have ever visited, the area is gridlocked by taxis and mopeds from morning till night. Footpaths barely worth walking on and vendors trying to rip you off every step of the way. The best part of the trip (11days) was definitely leaving and even that was difficult due to the lack of any organization at what the Balinese people pass off as an international airport. If your looking for a holiday to remember for all the right reasons avoid Bali.

been cooming to Bali for 4 tears and this place is going down hill fast
Over rated high prices -- garbage everywhere . Dirty filthy beaches . River chocked with garbage .
No fresh drinking water . Local hygeine is extremely questionable
Enviromental apathy . The idea seems that there are enough stupid foreigners to keep coming . Most people come for a week and most will never return .
Frankly I just disgusted with Bali as are many of my friends who have been coming for years . If you value your health and your money dont come here . Vote with your dollars and go somewhere else . The new Bali is EAT PAY LEAVE

Take a trip down to the beech with your love one 1 hour before sunset. Take a beer or buy one on the beech
grilled sweetcorn is for sale also. It is really tasty . If your lucky the local boys are playing football and the is a little cloud cover not to much. You don't need a expensive beech front bar you get the same sunset for free. Take your time and enjoy every sun set is special

If you need a private taxi use the most honest in Bali komang Suartawan see the number below

Though the beach are crowded, It is not as you expect in Phuket , Coral Island ( Pattaya )or Goa. It is not clean.. and It can get a little rowdy with those beach vendors and lots of taunting.

I was my first visit to Bali when I was visiting Bangkok, Thailand. I took me a little bit over 4 hrs and I paid $180 round trip from Air Asia! Great deal! Anyhow, I landed in Bali and the driver from the hotel was waiting for me at the airport & it was a complimentary from a boutique hotel in Bali. I got to my hotel and tons of scooters were near by the hotel and they were asking me if I wanted a tour. So, it is the deal! I got a driver+a tour guide+gas+I can go any where I want from 9am to 7 pm!!!! Only $18 a day!!! I told the guy yes and my journey began!!!! It was one of my greatest experience and excited since I travel solo! I highly recommended if you have not tried it yet! First if you travel with a budget Bali could be the best place for you! I spend $1-3 for my lunch and I used my points for my hotel. Gas is cheap people are very nice. Couple things that I love the most is Balinese temples, culture,massage and beaches. Great beautiful beaches comparable to Phi Phi Islands! Very unique style of temples and you can see the ritual everywhere in Bali. Cheap cheap massage!!!!! I love massage and I used to be a masseuse so trust me Balinese massage and spa are the best next to Thai massage! I think I only paid $12-15 for 2 hours massage!!!! Love it and miss it!! The beaches are gorgeous my tour guide, Henry tool me the best beaches and I would recommend Dreamland, Nusa Dua, Kuta beach! I would love to go back to visit in a heartbeat!

Kuta for the old timers like me, has evolved dramatically over the last 30 years, in the good old times you could get a room with a mosquito net and a big thermos full of Cha for US D 2.00 a day 25 meters from Kuta beach now on 2011 there is a string of designer boutiques, bars Go Go's all over K.F.C. and Mac as, more tourists than locals, the beach is not good news you will be hassled to buy this or that non stop, but you may like this, I will suggest move a bit away from Kuta Jimbaran Bay or Nusa Dua, even Legian is more quiet this days.

We travel to Bali annually-lucky us! We have seen the good, the bad and the ugly side of this wonderful island. So why do we keep returning? Simple: the people.
We do spend some time in and around Kuta each visit. We love the atmosphere and the shopping. This year I had a ring remodeled at Mayang Jewellers in Kuta Square and am very satisfied with the result. We love to shop in Matahari and then walk the length of Jl. legian back to our hotel.
There is a wonderful coffee shop on the corner of Jl Melasi and Jl. Legian called Coffee Corner.I would rate it the best coffee in Bali.
Now, being oldies we don't do the nightclub scene so can not make comment there. Suffice to say we have seen the aftermath at our hotel the mornings after and are I am not impressed with the behaviour of our young Australians who seem to think that any behaviour is acceptable and they can act in drunk and disorderly fashion simply because they can. Now I am no prude - to each his own. But if you are coming to Bali you need to see more than the inside of a club. Don't go home and say "I've been to Bali" if you have never ventured out of Kuta.

Kuta beach is always crowded with tourists and local people during the weekend. The beach is facilitate with some activities. There is hard rock cafe and hotel by the beach. However, the road by the beach is always jam and both side of the road are fully parked. You can hardly find an empty parking lot. I saw lot of people swimming while the others just hanging around on the beach. Children were building sand castles and the best time to go is around 6pm as you see the beautiful sunset on the beach.

I say Bali as a whole (beach and the countryside) is a fun and good adventure for me but the beach is over rated. Well, im from the Philippines and having seen the beaches of Boracay and Palawan (Coron, Puerto Princesa and El Nido), i can say the sand and water of Bali (Legian & Kuta) are nothing quite like these beaches. I enjoyed the countryside tour thou but all reviews seem to highlight Kuta Beach but doesnt seem extra ordinary for me. Sunset is divine and the hotels and accommodations are not expensive, foods too. If u havent been to white talclike beaches, Bali could pass as the better beach than Patong Thailand.

I'd a wonderful trip with my boy friend ans 2 colleagues in Bali.
We're not plan to shop around in Bali so we brough limited money, mainly for eat and sight-seeing. However, my colleague did find something where he is interested and he went for exchange USD to IDR at the Kuta street. Beware of the local as they might playing cheat while asking you to exchange more money to get better currency rates. Else, they will ask you to exchange more as the currency will drop tomorrow, where it's not true!
My colleague exchanged 100USD to IDR which he managed to get the exchange rate at I USD : 9395 IDR. The local count the money in front of us (4 people was in the shop), the strange thing is he was using small notes only, IDR20,000. 46 pieces of IDR20,000 gosh! After we left the shop, my colleague straight away went to buy his "baby" but he found out that he has only got 31 pieces of IDR20,000. and the 300,000IDR disappeared just like that. I can confirmed that the local playing trick while exchange the money, and i've no idea how he did it. Black magic maybe?!
Make sure you ask for big notes while exchange money and ask your friends to help to recount the money before leaving the shop. PS, never let them to take back the money after you counting!

After visiting Ubud for three days my adult son and I stayed in Sanur for two. We thought we should go to Kuta to see what it was all about, well what a mess. Totally commercial, of course stunning beach and surf but only if there were fewer people. Filthy streets and toilets and way too many tourists and tourist traps. One feels sorry for the true Balinese who need the money and thrive on tourism but the corruption and infiltration of other nationalities has robbed the place of it's authenticity. Definitely other places outside of Kuta are the places to go unless you want to spend your time with crowds and getting drunk. Sanur was a better choice.

5 years ago Kuta Beach was flat and sandy from the shore to the sea. This time I could see a great difference where the Indonesian government has to pour tons of sand on the shore to create a slope to the sea. I guess this is to prevent wave that will flood buildings on the shore. The sea is still beautiful and surfing is very popular. I prefer the sea shore near the Legian side instead near the Kuta Square. Huge building project is going on at the Kuta Square side and it is going to be similar to Pattay Beach Road one day. Greed will one day destroy this beautiful beach.

After a 13 year absence, I was sorely disappointed with the deterioration of Kuta Beach since last visiting. The small cottage stays are mainly bulldozed and there are now large cranes on the horizon building multi million dollar tourist resorts. The beach was extremely dirty, and the motorbikes riding on the footpath to get around the annoyance of a one way street made it quite dangerous at times for pedestrians. There were fellow countrymen of mine that made me feel quite ashamed by their poor behaviour, dress code and treatment of the Balinese people. Nobody wants to see your butt crack, nobody wants to see the only incident of road rage by a tourist who just doesn't get it. I wonder what the Balinese really think of these tourists....but have no choice but to be passive as they are so dependent on the tourist dollar for survival. It is a good thing, though, that they seem to all be drawn to Kuta Beach and not willing to venture further afield in Bali. On the upside, if you are keen for a bargain, wander around the backstreets behind JL Legian, including Poppies Lane 1 and Poppies Lane 2 for thoe $2 "Raybans", $4 "Casio" watches and shop after shop of the same clothes for all the family.

The beach is actually quite nice, its long and wite and has nice fine sand. But there are loads of hawker, every other metre (cool drings, sarong, massage ...) that quite penetrant. The sea is nice, no shells or sharp stones you step on with nice waves.
Most annoying are the loads of the groups of local people coming over from Java to spot the "nude white tourists" and photograph them. Even from three metres directly in front of you.
