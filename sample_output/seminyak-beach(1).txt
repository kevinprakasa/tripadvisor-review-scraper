The beach itself is sandy, fine and miles long. Not very suitable for swimming. Perfect for new surfers and bodyboards.
A sunset beach - late afternoon restaurants and bars along the shore, makes the beach into a bar-street.
Be aware of the tide !
Some places plastic and other garbage can drift in to the beach, due to current, wind and tide. Please bring a bag to help Seminyak a clean beach. Some of the sunbed owners often help to clean themselves Possible to snorkle some places very close to shore.
In all a superb beach, even if it is difficult to swim there.

There are a number bars on the beach serving food which was excellent and cheap as is the beer Bintang.
We walked from Butabelig beach to Kuta beach some 10 miles round trip. The beaches were full of plastics and general rubbish. I also picked up a light bulb and glass brown bottle which I dread to think what injuries they would have caused.
The sea is quite rough with warnings of strong currents and red flags.

Black sand that sticks to your feet. The amount of plastic and rubbish washed up on the beach is absolutely horrendous and upsetting. I cleared rubbish up on numerous occasions. They should employ people to clean the beach often to keep it clean. The sea is too rough to swim in but ideal for surfers. Has the most amazing sunset and is very popular for that.

Very disappointed. The beach is large and plenty of good bars and restaurants with bean bags to sit out on, eat drink and watch sunset. BUT there is so much plastic rubbish washed up with the tides.
This gets cleaned up, often with tourists helping. But the plastic and rubbish on beach is a huge problem and not a pleasure to walk through to get to the sea. Something needs to be done as this is not going away

Coolest, hippest, and the busiest part of Bali. Searched for a couple of accommodation options and chose to stay in Seminyak. Land transfers can be easily rented to any point of destination. Transportation within the area ranges from motorbike, GrabCar, GoJek, or the common Bluebird Taxi. We booked a decent hotel close to the beach. There are a lot of stores, restaurants, and specialty shops around. The beach provides a panoramic view by sunset and surfers flock in for the tide.

Visited the beach after my visit to Petitenget Temple as it is just across the carpark from it.

The beach reminded me of my uni days when I visited Mandura, Australia during summer.

The sand is black and fine and hence, when you attempt to walk along the beach, it is advisable to walk bear footed. It is rather safe to do so.

If you intend to swim, you have to do so in the safe zone (between the flags). The waves are crashing and therapeutic.

Sad that such a long and stunning beach is so filthy. The sewerage that flows in to it from the is smelly and disgusting. Further along the beach, in front of Ku De Ta, the sewerage doesn't flow, but plastic cups and straws mix with the offerings on the sand. You have to dodge the plastic in the ocean. It's great to see the sunset, if you look past the rubbish.

Dropped off at the beach by courtesy vehicle attached to our Seminyak accommodation. There were pay for toilets nearby however no changing sheds apparent. Eventually I paid an attendant for a toilet and changed in that. Felt that a beach of this size and popularity should have free well signed changing areas located at intervals along the beach front for beach goers to use. Also "Surfers Only" signage was clearly apparent on the sand along the beach and indicated to me as a visitor and other beach goers that there were no actual areas that that the swimmers could go without sharing the water space with those surfing. . This is in fact a safety hazard and appeared to be the case along the entire length of the Seminyak beach where the surf is rolling in. In the end - unable to find an area free of surfers and surf boards we ended up just dipping in the shallow areas and swimming in an area that was utilized by a few surfers and then out of nowhere a group arrived with instructors who were all learning to surf because no areas had been cordoned off for just swimmers. Not happy about this as an accident could have easily happened and we felt restricted in this beach/water situation.

Views of the sun setting in the horizon was magnificent to experience. Coupled with the atmosphere with crowds of people flocking the beach locals and tourists alike. All across the beach You See stretches of bars, restaurants and cafe, with outdoor settings. At night time the beach lights up with live bands and music catered for most senses.

Disappointing to see plastic and rubbish littered across the sands though. Effluent from nearby streams are washed out to see so stay away from these areas. Other than that, youll have local hawkers looking for a sale. If you catch there eye they will hone into you and haggle you to buy their products. Not just one but a flock of hawkers will surrounding your location causing frustation and potentially ruining your peaceful place. I learnt to say "no thank you" in Indonesian - tidak terima kasih which they acknowledge more than saying it in English. Try it and see.

Worth a visit, I wandered from my hotel and explored the beach I was just having a quick look so I did not rent a sunbed. I did have a lovely young coconut to quench my thirst. As soon as I sat down I had ladies approaching me to buy their wares. I thought it a good time to buy some gifts for fellow work colleagues. I got a quick massage which I think I paid too much for. As I walked along the beach I could see people horse riding, having surfing lessons, and many colourful beach bars. I was at the beach mid morning. Worth a visit.

This beach is fabulous with very colourful beach bars.
Always wear flip flops though as the sand gets ridiculously hot!
The tip i would give is stick to where the Air Asia umbrellas and loungers are. All the beach bars there have toilets.
Passed that it is cooler and hipper but the beach bars don‚Äôt have toilets and the public ones are closed!
Lovely chilled atmosphere with beanbag at the bars, which has no charge unlike the loungers. Just have to drink and/or eat.

Beautiful beach that stretches for miles and becomes very colourful as the sunsets with a hedonistic crowd and beautiful bean bags and umbrellas. The sand is yellow and the waters are a dark blue which can be wavy and rough but still very pleasant and great for surfers.

It wasn't a clean beach at all. Water from waste pipes were running straight into the sea. It smelled like the drains if Seminyak in most parts.

While Bali has various wonderful beaches, we felt Seminyak beach offered a perfect blend of beauty and fun. There were so many nice restaurants with romantic ambience, good music and good food. There were bean bags on the beach and you can spend hours looking g at the ocean. It gave such a surreal feeling. There are good places to shop also around the beach. Our best evening in Bali was on the Seminyak Beach without a doubt.

Seminyak Beach is beautiful to look at, especially at sunrise.

However, waves were very strong and difficult to swim in. Plastic was littered throughout the beach, stray dogs were everywhere doing their business, and it constantly smells like an outhouse.

There are much better beaches in the world to visit. I guess Bali doesn‚Äôt have them. It‚Äôs too bad they don‚Äôt care more about their environment.

Probaly would want to be a competant swimmer before you took a dip...
Also make sure your injection and imunisations are up to date as the water looks pretty dirty...

A great beach which is perfect for long walks or even runs.
The times I visited the sea was perfect fir surfers due to the waves and probably not too good fir swimmers.
This is a very popular beach for people to watch the sunset and wow they are amazing.
There are a number of bars and hotels to choose from should you wish to sit and have a drink while the sun goes down.
It gets very busy.

This is great beach but its mainly used by surfers as the waves are large. All the time we were there, its seemed to be kept clean.

There are lots of great bars to watch the sunset, the only downside was the hawkers trying to sell you stuff. A few of them would not take no for an answer.

I managed to go horse riding and its a great beach for this, its long and wide with lots of room.

Seminyak might comparatively be a quieter option among the ones you have on the stretch that includes Kuta and Double Six, but it can still get pretty crowded. Reason for that could be the fact that it has fantastic waves for those who seek to surf, and lets you enjoy one of the most majestic sunsets in the region. With an array of bars and restaurants facing the sea, you get enough and more places to just sit on a beanbag, gulp your beer with delicious starters, and enjoy the sunset. But with all those people and each restaurant playing their music, it can get a bit buzzy.

Not my favourite beach. I found it bit of a nuisance to get there first of all. What i found was a beautiful looking beech. What i missed was natural shelter trees etc. I wad also warned of the potential rips in the area maybe that was why there was not many people in the water. Sorry looks lovely but i prefer Kuta

The waves were huge great for the surf lessons(even they waited til later when it calmed) we saw several rips so not for the little ones. We tried to relax on the lounges and have a Bintang and a swim but we were hassled that much buy the local wares we gave up and went back to the hotel pool. At night it's a fantastic spot to relax in a bean bag and listen to the live music, have a meal and watch the sunset.

we stayed at seminyak and in the afternoon would go to the beach for a couple of bintangs and watch the sunset and we found this great bar called sunset hut run by Duncan and with the help of Frankie and Rodney what a great crew, and they are well traveled so knowledgeable of bail and many other places plus they are always keeping an eye on things, whilst we were there they saved 2 kids in a rip. Highly recommend it is just opposite jayakarta resort facing beach just to your left.

The beach is long and fairly wide so is generally not crowded. The sections with sun loungers are busier but still ok. The only really busy time and at sunset when hundreds visit to see the sunset.

The tide has been rough whilst here so not able to swim from the beach.

This a beautiful beach with some of the most beautiful sunsets I have ever seen, but don't expect to be able to swim as the waves are very strong. Unlike other reviewers, I found the beach very clean, there was no littering at all during my visit in August.

I stopped at the beach twice, once at sunset to enjoy the view and relax at one of the beach cafes, and it was perfect. The second time, I tried to swim and sunbathe and things were not ideal as the sand is black and tends to get very stick and hard to wash off, and the ocean has very strong waves.

So if you go for sunset and evening vibes, not for swimming, you will be very happy.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,14,40>===============  
Seminyak is good any time of the day, but from 4 p.m. onwards it takes on a whole new vibe. Lots of beanbags and umbrellas along the beach, out come the horses for a sunset ride. Chiringuito and La Plancha are great places for food and drinks. Chiringguito has the best wood fired pizzas, and nice clean toilets.

Seminyak Beach in the dry season is very clean. Compared to when I went in January when there was rubbish all over the beach, this time I went there was none! Make the effort to go down there before sunset and pull up an beanbag to soak up the sun, beer and sunset. I even saw lots of people swimming!

I wish I had known that it would cost to rent the sun beds every day as I would‚Äôve planned accordingly. Average price that people say is 200,000 but we haven‚Äôt paid above 100,000 for two.

We have found that outside Capil Beach is the best spot as such and if you come later in the day the guy will give you a cheaper price than the rest! If you rent a sunbed you can use the toilet inside the restaurant as well.

We also learnt to surf with these guys who are a right laugh and we both stood up first time

There is lots of surfers and areas not suitable to swimmers along this section of the beach so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to weak swimmers or young children

There is heaps of plastic and rubbish along the length of the beach, very sad to see! We have spent time out of our day to clean up
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,14,30>===============  
The beach is nice to walk on. the smooth white sand, nice sunsets and dotted with luxury resorts. However at the end of the beach before Legian beach or Double six, there is a smelly sewage that is hard to cross. We had to walk back..

We from West Australia go up here and always ask why don't they clean the beach? the views are breathtaking and people are nice just needs a government to get in with the right equipment and clean the beach every day and not dump rubbish in the ocean.

As a local tourist,Bali is my fav place to escape from the hectic life of Jakarta, so I prefer to stay near the beach and not in rush to visit many places. Seminyak beach is my fav to spend the time and enjoy the sunset. It has magical view to see when the Sun sets with the red and golden sky..

One of the most beautiful sunsets you can see in Bali is on the Seminyak beach. And if you like to enjoy sunset with a cocktail in your hand, there are plenty of bars with comfy bean bags. The atmosphere is great here! Although very crowded as this is a popular spot in Bali, so be prepared and come a bit earlier

It can be nice during the day as well, not a typical ‚Äúwhite sand blue water‚Äù kind of beach - but you can practice surf or have lunch while watching huge waves.

This beach is a nice place to relax. White sand and a great sunset to watch. The water current is high so it is not advisable to go for swimming.

Seminyak beach was ok, nothing great, and there was a fair amount of rubbish on the beach. They tried to cover it out by taking it out with a tractor I think, but as the day wore on it just all came to the surface of the beach.

Seminyak beach is a typical tourist beach which it slightly quieter than Kuta. We happily spent the day there renting sunbeds, and checking out the bars along the beach, definitely caters for all budgets. The beach can get extremely busy at times especially around sunset time.

Yes it‚Äôs slightly crowded, not so quite like Canggu or Nusa Dua. But, you can catch one of the most surreal sunsets from this beach. I was chilling on the Double Six Beach in Seminyak, had one of my best sunset experiences here. Well yes took advantage of the crowded places and met a lot of people, made conversations and learnt so many things on travelling and exploring Bali and more. It‚Äôs definitely worth it.

We went from Sanur to Seminyak initially for a couple days. it took 2 1/2 hours to get there its about 20ks. Check in to the medium priced city centre hotel which was ok? Then went for a walk on the beautiful beach NOT it was absolutely full of plastic right up to the high water mark. popped into a beachside hotel KU DE TA was the name. Talk about embarrassing. gangs of precocious teens spending rich daddies money on expensive drinks $20 a pop. Whilst teasing and laughing at the local beach hawkers. Needless to say we checked out the next day and went back to Sanur's pristine beaches and genuine people

It was a visit not with friends but with adult kids ... but since that option did not show, I consider my kids to be friends.

The beach is lovely. Large, windy, high waves, not too many people. Just the right place for a beach walk. Or a sunset picture. You do not go there for swimming or sun bathing.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,18,40>===============  
Seminyak Beach is a long strip of sand on Bali's west coast. It is largely a yellow sand beach but not especially fine. The waves are not huge but do much more than lap at the edges so the area attracts bodyboarders and the like.

The beach runs for quite a while so it is worth picking the right spot. A good option is in front of Ku De Ta as it seems to be a bit cleaner than some other parts. Sunbeds are available but are quite pricey, it is just as easy to use a towel instead.

The beach does have a fair few people but nowhere near as many as crowd into Kuta. This is not the leisure of isolation but equally is not overcrowded.

Cleanliness is always an issue on Bali beaches but it isn't terrible. Seminyak beach around Ku De Ta is in reasonable condition.

There are hawkers on the beach but aside from being intrusive they are not overly aggressive.

The beach itself is not ideal for sandcastle making but for splashing in the waves it is a really fun place.

Centrally located in bali, this beach is ok if you'd like to watch the sunset. However, it is quite crowded (mostly with Australians holidaying) and you would not be able to spend much time in water since seabed is really grainy. I even got grazed by a couple of pretty big stones while in water.
One advantage is that it is situated right opposite Ku De Ta beach club so you can swim/ relax/ watch sunset/ drink/ eat all in a couple of hours.

The beach itself is great, especially if after some waves....but it really needs looking after...I picked up broken glass on 2 occasions, and the amount of plastic waste coming on shore is a very sorry sight ...apart from myself and one family I saw picking the litter, I see no other effort generally...It‚Äôs all of us‚Äô problem and we need to take collective responsibility for it :-)

This is really quite a nice place to visit. I'd recommend getting here an hour before sunset, finding some bean bags at one of the beach bars and ordering some drinks and appetisers to watch the sunset.

It's a nice vibe and most of the bars are either playing Balearic beats or have live acoustic musicians going on.

It does get busy, but it's nicely chilled out and an enjoyable way to watch the sunset.

There are lots of vendors walking past trying to sell you trinkets, but they aren't pushy and a gentle wave off sends them on to someone else.

Plenty of places around for food and drink too.

I didn‚Äôt find much to enjoy at Seminyak Beach. Murky water, rubbish everywhere and crowds of people wandering around taking pictures of said water and rubbish.

Nice clean beach, many options for light lunch and a beer on the beach. The restaurants have clean toilets, so a family day out is good. You can bargain for the sun beds and even book by the hr so don‚Äôt pay the initial asking price.

Lovely sandy beach however, there are stray dogs that roam free along the beach and do their business on the sand so you do have to be careful where you're walking... The beach is packed at around 6pm when the sunsets but when we went for a walk down the beach around 6:30ish there is a marge amount of litter that people leave behind, tourists and local people seem to thing it's ok to leave the bottles and plastics lying around for the tide to come in and wash it all out to sea. That was the disappointing this as we were expecting a beautiful beach which is was until sunset, it was just a shame that people couldn't do their bit to help keep it tidy too...

This is Seminyak, it is busy and there is lots to look at. The beach is not beautiful, and we did not swim here, although others were surfing. You can see that it has rips, so be careful.

This is truly a beautiful beach, on our current family holiday of SE Asia we hired a private villa very close to this beach. Myself and wife had a morning run each day along the beach, it was beautiful. After breakfast the whole family would go back to the beach for sea swimming and surfing, with the super soft sand this beach has everything. As with most beaches the terrible waste washed up on the beach was evident to see, however there were local groups who regularly worked in groups to clean the beach (well done to the locals doing your bit for the environment)

Arrived at the beach on our first night after dark, no idea or concept what lay in front of us! We ate at one of the beach places that had bean bags on the sand whilst we listened to the live music. Nice and sandy beach and seemed clean.

Next morning we came back down to spend the day and were welcomed by the most amazing surf and sandy beach! Miles long with plenty of space.

We hired a couple of sun beds (haggle- we got them down to 100,000 rupees for two for the whole day).

Stay till the sun goes down, the colours are amazing!

Watch out for the stray dogs though.

Great beach.

Best beach in Kuta, sunset is wonderful, very clean area. At night, there will be enjoyable parties at the beach.

Seminyak beach has a good selection of bars at the top of the beach. These bars put out bean bags for sunset. The food at these bars is a bit higher prices than off the beach.
There are plenty of sun beds available anytime of year, even more at high season. The sunbed sellers also rent surf/boogie boards and give surging lessons.
A direct route to Seminyal beach is down Jalan Campung Tandak.

Ambience is different from Kuta Beach. This beach is located in the luxurious Seminyak area which is offered a new style of enjoying Bali beaches.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,22,40>===============  
The beach goes on forever, its very clean, the sea is warm and very wavey - too strong even for surfing throughout our visit. With very strong currants also.
Price of sunbeds vary along the beach, and there are not many places to get onto the beach from the road.
The beach isn't crowded in terms of people sitting on it, but there are always hundreds of people walking along the beach.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,22,30>===============  
This part of a long strip isn‚Äôt so developed even the beach road is full of branded shops nobody needs. We came across of one of the beach clubs and had a break for a drink. There are only tourists sitting with a smartphone and taking selfies and staring on it. Creepy & funny at the same time. They pay a lot of money to fly thousands of miles and end up in one of the beach club with their smartphones. I feel it‚Äôs so boring and after the drink we left.
So Seminyak beach is more for overdressed tourists which forget to shop at home or believe that branded stuff is cheaper here. And along the beach is like a canal. Very smelly and not nice.

Seminal beach is very clean.
The people that sell goodies on the beach are Lovely they take no for an answer.

Security guards are very friend along with Balinese people always smiling.
BEAUTIFUL sunsets to see.

Beautiful sunsets with friendly locals.
We stayed at the Breezes Resort & Spa which was in short walking distance to Seminyak Beach. The beach is lovely to walk along, but I wasn't enticed to swim. My husband ticked off his bucket list item to learn surfing.
You can hire a shaded deck chair for 50,000IDR - depending on your negotiating skills this could be for a couple of hours or a whole day (depending on demand as well!)
Great beach for long walks as you can stop for refreshment at plenty of places along the way.

Found that the beach was not overcrowded. Overall quite neat. Enough vendors around if you want to grab a bite or drink. Had a great time at the beach. Waves were quite intense which made the experience all the more enjoyable.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,23,30>===============  
My family and I wandered to the beach via Ku De Ta and paid for a couple of chairs, umbrella, and boogie boards (I think we paid 150,000). There were not many people on the beach, as it was a weekday and it was later in the afternoon. If you go, expect to be hassled by the wandering vendors. I must have been asked 20 times if I wanted to buy a watch, sarong, kite, get a massage, or have my hair braided. It gets annoying when you're trying to close your eyes and rest. While the beach looks nice, the smell is more of a port a potty. I kept looking for canals of water pushing raw sewage into the ocean, because that's what it smells like. My whole family noticed it, and eventually we left - not staying for sunset because the smell was just terrible.

I‚Äôm more of a white-sand-beach-kind-of-girl but I actually enjoyed seminyak beach. It‚Äôs a surfer‚Äôs haven I guess. Coz of the waves. Good ones. I found the sand a bit glittery and shiny (though it‚Äôs brown/dark) so I enjoyed walking, enjoying the sun and the wind. It‚Äôs not too crowded compared to Kuta. A lot of people offering umbrellas and beach/lounge chairs but it‚Äôs pricey and you pay per hour. I suggest you bring a mat or beach towels instead of paying for those chairs.

The beach is great for walking along. It us windy which makes it pleasant. I did venture in for a dip but I came out stinking. This may have something to do with sewage system near the beach. There are many hotel restaurants to stop and have a drink or meal.

I have been coming to Bali on Business for years and one of the trip's highlights is the blissful moments where I can walk the Seminyak beach! Although the sand is not white but more volcanic black it is not as black as other beaches in Bali. I enjoy the short motor bike ride to the beach where I park it. I then walk for about 45 minutes towards Batu Belig Beach where I dine at Warung Pantai, a superb and very reasonably priced beach restaurant. I enjoy the sunset there, usually order grilled Mahi Mahi with Salad and steamed rice or vegetables spring rolls, fresh squeezed lime juice, have a great cup of Bali Coffee before heading back by night towards Legian beach. At night there are very few people on the beach, it is cool and all the night lights of all the beach venues are so pretty. The authorities/ residents have really cleaned up the beach a lot and this year I witnessed very little litter in spite of the fact that by day there are people in abundance. Walking the beach at different times you will see the hoards of sunbathers by day, resident expats walking their dogs, children playing, oldies walking, local balinese with their families, people making offerings, people doing yoga, brides and grooms having photo shoots on horseback or in the waves....you will see so much as you walk this beach. Depending on the time of the day the sea will also have a different beauty...sometimes calm & blue, in the evening navy blue with golden reflections of the sunset, all the spray of the rolling waves catching the beautiful sundown rays.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,24,50>===============  
Seminyak beach along the Anantara stretch is quieter, less crowded. You can walk for miles with the waves just kissing your feet and the wind blowing. Not much bother here from people peddling their wares.

Seminyak beach is probably one of the best I have ever seen. There is miles of golden sand and clear blue water.
It seems to be quite popular for surf boarding and we saw people having lessons.
There are quite a lot of beach clubs spread out along the beach all serving food and drinks.
We ate and had drinks at a very relaxing beach club (the name escapes me) which was on 'potato head' beach. There were bean bags parasols, a small swimming pool with a children's area and a dining area. This place was so chilling, it was hard to leave.
The sunsets on this beach are beautiful.

Great waves, huge pull out to sea though so you have to be really careful with younger children. Cheap rental of sun loungers and surf boards. One warning if you buy anything from one of the beach seller's do it from a fixed one (there's plenty of little stalls) other wise they will all not leave you alone, we felt quite harassed at one point and we just all got in the sea to hide lol!!

Great beach for activities like surfing. A lot of boards to rent and teachers who can show you surfing. Not expensive. Great bars and restaurants where you can hide if you have enough of sun and buy some cold drinks and cocktails.
Great place for sunset view and chilling with live music every night. Really highly recommended.

A highlight of my trip to Bali would have to be having sunset drinks on Seminyak Beach. The live music, comfy beanbags and good location are amazing. The beach has an assortment of restaurants catering for everyone.

The beach itself is quite nice. The surf is popular and many tourists hire day beds on the beach. I would recommend a visit to Seminyak Beach!

Seminyak beach is a one of the best beaches in Bali. The beach is one of the cleanest in Bali so the water is good not slot of garbage in the water! Nice waves and good for beginner surfers. The negative thing is that some of the people who wanna rent sun beads (especially the ones near the entrance to the beach) will try to take over prices like 100 k for one sun bead but if you walk a bit further you can get one for 50 k. There are also people who will try to sell things to you, some of them are nice and will take no for an answer and some won't and can get rude and nasty with you (especially men who try selling you paintings, don't know why).
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,26,30>===============  
OK, you're in Bali, of course you want to visit the beach. Well, once you've arrived and "experienced" the local culture (ie the incessant touting for business by every stall-holder, vendor, taxi, massage parlour and anything else that can make a dollar, you might think the beach offers a degree of solace. Think again. You are accosted by sun-lounge and umbrella renters, surf lessons and personal services, some of a VERY intimate nature and all along a beach that whilst comprising of sand that is, in places, blacker than most (after all, this is a volcanic island), does contain a fair amount of rubbish, so watch your step!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,26,50>===============  
Visited the beach all most each day , it‚Äôs a great place to relax and unwind or go for a long stroll, you can also learn to surf which for someone who has never tried was a bonus. This is not the type of beach you would expect as it is a surf beach and the waves are quite high but it was impressive seeing the surfers catch wave after wave. There are places to eat along the beach but never tried any so can not really comment on them. We used the beach to walk back to our hotel from
Both Kuta and Seminyak square .The down side was lots of dogs running wild doing what dogs do and lots of hawkers selling souvenirs but guess they are only trying to make a living.

Two streams pouring their fetid bile onto the beach makes you think twice about going for a swim. And then there is the rubbish, plastic, dropped and ignored.

Unfortunately this volcanic ash beach is terrible. There is dirt flowing down tiny little streams from building sites to the ocean. The ocean itself is not clean and if you happen to put your toes in and think the water looks clean, just view it from on high from a hotel room and you will see the pollution. The surf is dangerous with huge currents.

We always at least once a trip visit the beach for a late afternoon walk! Generally the tide is out and it‚Äôs less busy. The kids love looking for hermit crabs and splashing about in the shallows.

For someone from Chennai, this beach wasn‚Äôt something to write home about. Pretty small beach. Short walk to the sea. Can become dirty. Didn‚Äôt seem like a place for offshore activities - these are in other places in Bali. OK for just relaxing and sitting in the sand.

Quite frankly, found nothing of interest in the beach. Which is both good and bad in its own ways.

We came here a few times during our 6 day stay in Seminyak. It‚Äôs a great place to relax and watch the sunset. I enjoyed body surfing here as the waves get pretty big and the current is strong. However, you need to be careful; especially if you are not a strong swimmer. My boyfriend ended up in the hospital after nearly drowning when he went body surfing.

Not the best beach I've ever seen, but it was a great place to watch the sunset. The beach is a hive of activity during the day with beach chairs and umbrellas as far as the eye can see, surfing lessons, beach bars and beach sellers. If you like walking do yourself a favour and walk along the beach to Legian rather than taxi. It far quicker and way more pleasant

Wonderful place to rest and relax after an emotional journey to Jakarta and other sites in Bali. Found a nice spot and rented and all-day bed at the beach to rest and relax with a good book. Food comes to you and the beauty parlours as well. But it is never when you want to have their services. Quite annoying to have vendors hoovering around you until you purchase something and they are happy to leave. But others follow....

Seminyak beach is littered with trash. We went here to beach comb and walk what we hoped was a beautiful Balinese beach. Within metres of stepping onto the beach you are surrounded by plastic of every type,dead animals, syringes and all manner of garbage. What humans have done to this place is shameful and dangerous. I'd gladly pay a little more in an entry tax if it to be used to clean the beaches. Do not go and certainly don't take children to the beach.

The beach is nice if you like sandy beaches that don‚Äôt dive off into the deep end too soon! It‚Äôs a good long stretch of about 5 or 6KM making it ideal to make long beach walks on.
It is however incredibly busy and polluted here and there where you see dirty water coming from inland go out to see on a few spots near Canggu and Seminyak too.
It makes it not so nice to swim in unless you are a long wat out from the pour out points, it smells there too!
The water and the waves are very nice though to boogie board or surf on. For swimming be careful with the strong currents as they can be deceptive. You will see red flags with do not swim advice and it‚Äôs best to heed them.
Lounging and relaxing on the many caf√©‚Äôs and bars along the beach is particularly nice close to sunset!

This was the best spot for enjoying the water.
The sand was pure and the beach was clean, but a bit crowded.

We absolutely loved the water here. Small, but intense waves makes it great fun in the water for playing, swimming or even surfing.

So far this is one of the best beaches we've seen in Bali.

Visited for a special birthday.
Beach is fab, the waves are great fun. The traffic in Seminyak is unrelenting, whatever the time there is coming start flurry of scooters and cars through the narrow streets which makes journeys long.
The people are friendly everywhere and all times felt very safe. Lots to see and do and as everywhere is resonably priced all the family can participate in lots of activities. If you want a relaxing holiday though this isn‚Äôt the area to stay!!!!

We stayed for 2 weeks 12 minutes walk away from the beach at Kudeta Beach Club. Each time we came out on the beach it did not cease to amaze. We walked in the shallows most mornings and evenings and it was clean....so much cleaner than the very public beach of Kuta (Legian) which we did once at the end of our stay. In Seminyak there seem to be more expatriates who live in the area and try to keep this beach clean. One would see them walking along picking up bits of rubbish (not that there ever was that much to pick up). I enjoyed the beach at low and high tide and anywhere in between. Also the beach sellers (which we met near sunset) are a friendly bunch.

We are appalled at the lack of respect that people have for what drives people to Bali island in the first place. My wife and I spent 3 hours picking up debris of the beach rather than swimming. We found syringes / diapers/ plastic bottles / wrappers/straws etc... A young lady was sunbathing next to a dead rat and didn‚Äôt even know it. I hope that tourist and locals can all leave the beach in better care than when they arrive. It‚Äôs a beautiful place but needs tighter controls in managing this national treasure!

Nice beach for swim and relax with white sandy, cool for sunset. A lots of restaurants and hotel surrounding to visit and stay. Worth to visit and so fresh air

Really nice beach, you pretty much have to order and pay for a sun bed to enjoy though because the sand isn't deep enough to lay a towel down on

Loads of places to eat and drink along the beach, most places have free wifi. The surf is rough, the beach is clean! Some people say its dirty but Ive been told it may look like that because of the black sand. Great spot to eatch the sunset at 6pm.

Hawkers aren't too aggressive here, and while vendors have established price cartels, you can knock 5,000 rupiah (about 50 Aussie cents) off a 30,000 beer on the sand.

Great beach for walking running in the morning. There is not much chance of getting a good walk or run on the pavements in Seminyak. But this beach provides great access to a run to Kuta(10km) turnaround. Just be prepared to get your feet wet

Nice food, loud music... only till 12pm, food served till 12pm. But they do allow u to enjoy the beach on their sandbags till whenever u want .... fresh air and the night beach walk is what I loved about Bali

A very huge beach with white sands that easy for swimming or just walking along. Lots of sitting area for rent paid to the locals, no place to change or clean up though. The best way is to stay at hotels that offer beach club and shuttle, or even better in front of the beach
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,31,40>===============  
After The Jimbaran, Seminyak was the next best beach we experienced. As I mentioned earlier also that if you plan to stay in Seminyak you must stay at the beach front or close to the beach. It is a very lively area , shopping pubs and restaurants: nice place the stay and move around
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,31,30>===============  
A bit dirty and overcrowded. Came here for a long walk and to watch the sunset on a beachbag. If you're staying in Seminyak, I recommend coming for one day but then hiring a driver to take you to other prettier, cleaner beaches.

Seminyak beach is a nice beach but not amazing by any means. Expect black sand though . You can get cheap cold bintang from the guys at the top and rent beach chairs for 100,000 rupiah . There are many sellers up and down the beach . Wasn‚Äôt to busy in the month of May .

Great place to finish the day. Plenty of entertainment and characters. Sunsets are postcard quality. Plenty of options from blankets to bean bags or day beds to relax on with drinks and friends.

Beaches are not the most beautiful in Bali but for sunset it's a must do to sit on one of the many bean bags and watch the sunset. Bit cloudy yesterday

One of the good beaches on the offer in Bali while they have many. overall the beach is good to hangout during the day expecially for the couple.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,32,50>===============

Seminyak Beach is a long stretch of grey sandy beach situated in an upscale and private neighbourhood thats famous for its fabulous sunsets....
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,32,30>===============  
beach is not the cleanest, water can be very rough, but warm when you can use it, no facilities on beach for food/drink etc but can be bought not too far away.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,32,40>===============  
I had read the reviews for Seminyak beach but was pleasantly surprised. The water was lovely to swim in although caution is needed as the waves can be quite strong and only a small section is partrolled. Beach beds and umbrellas can be hired and cold drinks also on offer at reasonable prices. Most of the sun beds belong to the upmarket hotels along the beach. A few hawkers but they are not particularly aggressive. The sand was clean and free of litter. The occasional horse rider along the foreshore is a real treat. Beautiful place to pass the time and watch the sunset.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,32,50>===============  
Lovely well kept beach with lots of amenities. Sunbed hire cheaper if u walk up to double six part of beach.

Asia and Seminyak Beach in this instance is drowning in plastic and it is disturbing as it is disgraceful.
If your happy to swim amongst plastic straws, food wrappers, plastic tubes from toothpaste to skin bleaching cream I could not recommend this beach highly enough:(
Bali has lost it for me as the pollution is now out of control.
The lack of infrastructure and us bargain hunting holiday hounds have taken its toll.
I‚Äôve been going to Bali for 30 years and seen it go from sublime to submerged.
What a shame :(
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,33,50>===============  
I prefer being here in the late afternoon/evenings, just to sit and watch the world go by, happy on a beanbag, I also bought some cute treats from sellers here!
I didn‚Äôt swim, but it‚Äôs just so relaxed. My fave location on the beach is the b9b bar :)
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,33,50>===============  
Seminyak Beach is great for walking in either direction. Surf lessons, not crowded, great photo opportunities, the Bali clouds as a back drop. And sunsets are a time for people to gather and take lots of photos.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,33,40>===============  
Plenty of places to eat or you can just stroll the beach and watch the sunset. Plenty of hawkers trying to sell you many things that you possibly don't need but it adds to the atmosphere. Visit the beach for a sunset if you have the time.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,33,30>===============  
Spent 7 days in the area, we enjoyed Legian beach much better, more lounges, friendlier bar owners, music playing with much better atmosphere. Seminyak beach had darker sand than Kuta and Legian and also had fresh water drains flowing into the sea, this may be the reason for the darker sand. Much more enjoyable at Legian and only a short walk down the beach.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,33,50>===============  
We stayed at the Marriott which was very good but the streets are busy and noisy. The restaurants are a bit rough but down on the beach is really nice.

The peddlers get really tiresome.

We won't go back to Seminyak but at least we saw it and it was good way to start to our 3 week vacation. Go to Ubud instead.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,33,30>===============  
The beach itself is quite littered with cigarette bits and general rubbish. It's a great location with plenty of bars and restaurants right in the beach and a really good vibe.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,33,40>===============  
Great beach for all of the family if you like waves , which my 3 kids do. Plenty of sun lounges to chose from for a cheap price.
Don't pay anymore then IDR100,000 for two lounge beds. That's about Aud $10.00 ( Aud$5.00 each lounge.)
Cool drinks not far away and plenty of shopping options passing you by ( literally ). Sandy beach and very clean.
They also have flags set up showing were its safe to swim.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,33,40>===============  
It is a beach.
The sea is most of the times to dangerous to swim in.
Surfing yes.
A lot of trendy places to have a drink, lay down, some have a pool.
Very nice warungs for local food, not expensive.
Popular is watching the sunset.
Sitting on the beach on a beanbag.

Whilst the sand is not pure white by any means, this beach is cleaned daily and all rubbish (if any) removed. Deck chairs abound, and when the surf is ‚Äúup‚Äù, it is ideal for surfing.

Long stretch of good sand. Sea is not generally recommended for swimming due to the surf waves but there are some safer areas under surveillance. Fabulous sunsets .
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,34,30>===============  
The beach at Seminyak is black sand, small waves and lots of rips. However, it is an amazing place to watch the sun go down, to sip on a cocktail or two or simply lounge around on a very comfortable bean bag. You have to visit, so go between 4 and 7pm... the most action and great for people watching!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,34,30>===============  
Very safe surf beach, clean by Bali standards but water quality not the best. A great place to watch the sunset whilst enjoying a cold and very cheap Bintang from a bean bag and having a neck and foot massage.
The street / beach sellers are everywhere but not too aggressive and it‚Äôs fun to barter with them ( you can offer low prices without offending them) and sometimes pick up a real bargain.
If you frequent the same ‚Äúhosts‚Äù on a regular basis they will treat you like royalty and remember you for years.
Certainly safe for all the family.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,34,50>===============  
When you walk through the entrance, past the parking area, and over the bridge, there are women who try to sell sarongs and bracelets. I have no use for both, so I did not purchase any.
There was even a man selling canvas unframed paintings for 800,000 Rupiah, which he claimed he painted and ‚Äúused to have a shop‚Äù in Seminyak, but he sold it.

Beautiful beach to watch the waves, and lay out. I rented a beach chair and umbrella for 50,000 Rupiah ($3.50 USD) which was a deal, as when I was in the Caribbean, the Beach Chair and Umbrella rental was $25 USD and you must order expensive food off their Menu, like a $15 cocktail and $25 hamburger, so this was a bargain.

I was there about 11:00am, with hardly anyone on the beach. An hour before Sunset, many people were coming to the beach. Kids playing soccer on the sand. Everyone there to watch the sunset. I probably had about 3 different vendors come up to try to sell, but none were persistent. I politely said no, and they walked away.

Beautiful Sunset views.

However the street hawkers on the beach do spoil it a bit .... Beer ? Chair? Jewellery? Sunglasses? Rings ? etc

The beach sand is grey with dirt, but still really popular at sunset, with the beach crowded, especially on the week-end and around Full Moon time

A large expansive beach which has a very gentle gradient into the sea. Excellent for families to swim or those that do not like large wave activity. Can get very busy with many holiday makers enjoying the area. Lots of people surfing ( or trying to ) which was at time a good laugh. The beach was relatively clean with very little rubbish which was pleasing to see. The hawkers weren't bad, a few of them, but no trouble. A very good beach to relax at.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,34,50>===============  
Walked off a hangover whilst my friend slept hers off!! Very nice clean beach. I didn‚Äôt get harassed much by the sellers, there were lots of surf lessons available, restaurants and bars were set slightly back from the beach so as to not ruin the peace!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,34,40>===============  
It's a beach, it is clean and ad you'd expect has a good selection of lounger for the day. 50,000 seems to be the going rate. Some do towel hire too.

The hawkers are there but not intrusive. You will pay a bit of a premium for drinks the closer you are to the big hotels but the warungs rather than the beach huts offer better value and reasonable food. Try cantina to the right of W. Has a decent toilet too.

Watch the current, it is strong and swim only where there is a lifeguard.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,35,30>===============  
It is lovely being near the beach and viewing it from restaurant decks etc but I did not like being on the beach so much. We are spoilt in Australia, beautiful white sand so the dark colour was a little strange. I did not enjoy swimming as there was quite a bit of rubbish in the water
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,35,50>===============

Visited here April / May 18, and was pretty disappointed. The sea is very rough and no good for swimming. There was a lot of rubbish washed up on the beach. In our 10 day stay we only went to this beach once as the visit did not inspire us to come back for a 2nd visit. In fact struggled to find a beach in Bali that impressed us....can't beat the Caribbean for me!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,35,30>===============  
Nice beach to watch the sun go down. Can get a bit polluted throughout the year. Too many hawkers pushing their wares. Wouldn‚Äôt swim here...but that‚Äôs just me.

Seminyak beach is ahead of Kuta and Legian beach and have some of the world's top hotels with private beaches. I stayed on Legian beach area and used to run every morning to Seminyak beach.

We stayed close to the beach at Petitenget and found it refreshingly uncrowned with huge stretches of lovely sand. My Partner lives to body board and the waves here were perfect for this

Great sand beach: take surflessons, buy fresh coconut drink, surfboards for rent. Relax ia only thing you have to do.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,35,20>===============  
Maybe it is because I live close to the beach in Southern California that I was so disappointed, but without any emotions and just being realistic about what I saw - the beach is full of trash, rough sand and huge crowds. The beach side hotels are a turn-off, much better to stay away and close to Eat Street. I would not put a foot into that water.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,35,30>===============  
With a couple of Bintang Beers and spicy burgers, we relaxed on comfortable cushions with other travellers, tourists and families and enjoyed the lively music provided by a variety of musicians. One of the pleasurable experiences, after eating and shopping, that is on offer in beautiful Seminyak, Bali.

A magnificent place to swim
Mostly very clean ocean

If torrential down pour then the sewerage can infiltrate the water - not good at all

It‚Äôs a tropical island though

Very peaceful
Waves perfect

Well policed with surf life savers

No sharks
No jelly fish

Have fun and enjoy the morning walks at 6 sunrise with all the tourists and locals and families

Seminyak beach has the potential to be one of the best beaches in the world- but I was shocked at the amount of garbage and litter. It was truly heartbreaking to see- also almost all of the bars, restaurants and vendors on and near the beach use plastic straws, plastic bags and single use cups which is absolutely insane given the state of the beach. They should really put a ban on plastics in the area and put an effort in to clean the beach up.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,36,50>===============  
Really liked this beach, was beautiful and peaceful.
Not too busy or too many posers about.
Some lovely vendors to, if you give them a chance and get talking to them.
The sea was good fun, big waves but felt safe mucking about.

Tasty snacks and cold beers available just over the bridge

This was the section of beach by a temple and the mexicola bar
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,36,40>===============  
Good sandy beach with waves. Many restaurant and beach bar is on the beach. Beach is hughe and not crowded. You can hire or find for free sunbeds and umbrella (if you order drink from beach bar)

Good destination for a few days if passing through. Local government together with hotels needs to try to tackle the issue otherwise people will stop coming.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,36,40>===============  
The beach at Seminyak is much preferable than Kuta. Seminyak is a bit quieter and the people who are at Seminyak seem more international and discerning.

The gentle rolling waves are ideal for beginner surfers and it is also good for swimming. Just a shame a bit the bits of plastic floating in the waters. Really sad to see. I picked up them myself and disposed of them in the rubbish bin and so did a few other tourists. If we all do that at the beaches in Bali, we can try to beat the plastic pollution problem.
Oh, the sunsets at Seminyak are a sight to behold! Grab a bean bag and a drink and drink it all in.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,36,30>===============  
Pleasant beach for a walk . Cleaner than we were expecting. Over-all worth a visit but unless you like big crowds on bean bags and constant interruption by touts, you will probably only visit once.Cafes and bars dearer that in town and not as good. We went once for a daytime walk , and once for a sunset. After that , we had no reason to return.
Its a personal choice.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,36,10>===============  
This place has views that are priceless however the beach was dirty and rubbish blowing all around you, people constantly badgering you selling their items was a pain and not the best place we felt for safety. View yes beach no it was nasty
,who goes to a beach to pick a spot sitting there with rubbish at the side of them.
We chose here for our wedding vow renewal and were very disappointed, don‚Äôt bank on this place for a wedding shot there is so much better places then here in the hills by the rice fields Bali struggles at best.
We had to clear rubbish first as there was no gaps on the beach as there was already rubbish there and strangely enough a person came along to pick it up removed leaves from the trees that had fallen on the beach and left the rubbish go figure very odd.
The view yes but just to get this shot alone yep we had to turn in to rubbish collectors before our wedding vow renewal not ideal but we had flown so far it was poor to say the least not a great start for a special day.

=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,36,30>===============  
This is a great beach for walking however it is not without problems, mainly cleanliness. Most of this comes from offshore so is difficult to control and the hotels try and clean their part. The other issue is dogs messing on the beach. In Bali dogs are free to roam and you have to treed carefully.
Sunsets are fantastic however.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,36,40>===============  
Seminyak Beach is particularly great in the afternoons as the day cools as it can be a bit of a hot place, don't get me wrong you can hire lounge chairs and umbrellas, cool drinks are never to far away. I particularly like the beach for it's beach break and good surf, I surfed Ku De Ta (in front of) and Seminyak beach in from of the temple, both spots are equally as good, most prefer to surf in front of Ku De Ta. Seminyak beach is extremely popular at sunset as the view is breathtaking. At night time the restaurants and bars along the foreshore have bands and live music. There is always a buzz of life at Seminyak beach from the colourful people selling their wares, offering massages and all the beautiful life interactions.

Definitely a place to visit and relax at..

Dont understand what tourists see in this foul smelling and overcrowded beach. THis used to be a great spot 20 years ago but has deteriorated to such a point that I wouldn't even walk my dog there. One can see seweage water being pumped onto the beaches and frankly some of the worst eateries and bars in the area. Stay away if you're looking for a white sandy beach.

Seminyak Beach reckoned as best place to enjoy sunset. It is the same coast as Kuta Beach with wider sand bed line for evening walk. thin sea water over the sand create wide mirror effect. during visit it was bit cloudy, yet still able to got few minutes of sparkling golden sunset before covered by lower cloud.

Good beach
Good for boogie boarding but strong under current so swim near life guards
Lots of places to hire beach beds, boogie boards and surfboards

Bars all along which aren't as cheap as other places but the sunset view is worth the few extra dollars per beer
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,37,40>===============  
Seminyak beach is a great place to swim, surf and most of all watch the sunset. There are a number of bars that have live music on the beach, recorded music and you can chill out sitting on a bean bag, drink Bintang (or any grog you like) and watch the sunset.
Great for singles, couples and families. A must to visit when in Bali, in particular the most popular outdoor spot is La Plancha. Get the at least an hour before sunset.
The only negative is the non-stop approaches by street vendors trying to sell you anything from paintings to hats. Just in gnome them and enjoy the location. They soon will leave you alone.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,37,40>===============  
Came here to watch the sunset. The beach is full of people, DJs, live music, merchant sellers, multiple beach venues with alot of hotels having little beach clubs. Find a spot and enjoy it on beanbags and table service.

Time your moment and you can have that perfect beach sunset photo.

A nice black sand beach, beautifully maintained. I hung at the hotels pool and later ventured down to the beach to relax in the sand during sunset. This is not a beach for relaxing and swimming.

We had a great stay at the White Colonial Villa in Seminyak. We were here last 10 years ago and wow has it developed but in a positive way. Definitely trying to keep class and an identity. Really enjoyed being in the hustle but being able to hide and chill out in the villa.

We came here two days in a row just for the sunset, best time to start at the beach is about 17.15pm local time where the sun is not too blinding to walk down the beach. And subset is about 19.00ish.. during the month we were here which was April, there wasn‚Äôt any large crowd at all so it was peaceful according to our driver the peak season is from May onwards. The beach was huge, lush sands but mirky water of course. Don‚Äôt expect blue or crystal clear waters.. lots of happy dogs running freely at the beach. Only thing that was a turn off was there was a dirty river of water flowing from one of the hotels in the middle of the beach straight down into the beach waters. It was so smelly and awful sight that the hotel‚Äôs dirty water was flowing towards the beach waters. You wouldn‚Äôt miss walking through it as it is a huge opening of water flowing down through the beach. But just don‚Äôt think of it and it will be fine!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,38,30>===============  
The sunsets on Seminyak beach are amazing! The sea is calm with an occasional wave the surfers try to catch. The off-putting smell of the surface water running from the village is a little off-putting at times if you are walking the length of the beach. There are some fantastic restaurants and bars along the edge of the shore. If you are getting around by taxi be careful - please ensure you use a ‚Äòblue bird taxi‚Äô and ask for the meter to be put on. The taxi fare from one end of the town to the other is approximately ¬£1 - ¬£2. Other cabs try to copy the blue bird company by calling themselves ‚Äòblue biro‚Äô, of ‚Äòblue taxi‚Äô but they are very very expensive.

As always here the water is polluted with rubbish, feacies, the beach is polluted with rubbish. It‚Äôs packed with drunk tourists who piss in the sand. There are several homeless wild uncared for starving dogs roaming the beach it‚Äôs very upsetting. If you are on the beach or at a beach bar you will be constantly harassed by hawkers trying to sell you things so it‚Äôs definitely not peaceful or relaxing. They sell lasers to anyone so there are tourists shining lasers up at planes flying in and into other peoples eyes and also poor dogs eyes. I stop a few kids from doing that and told them off their parents were blind drunk and careless.surfs okay you can catch great waves early morning and view some nice sun sets in the arvo. See for you self.

We ventured to Seminyak beach like all tourists to see the Sunset. The Sunset was stunning, so worth it. The beach itself is dirty... rubbish from people everywhere - did not swim at this beach. Brown dirt sand with rubbish sitting on the shoreline. Same at Legian and Kuta all the way along that coastline. Such a shame this place is marred by rubbish from human use.

Do yourself a favour and call Made when you holidaying in Bali. Best driver we have ever had and we have been a few times now. Made speaks great English and knows the areas and customs / history very well. Made has many contacts in Bali so is a wealth of knowledge. Easy to contact through messenger so organising all our transport requirements was a breeze. Thanks Made! I have taken a photo of Made‚Äôs business card for your reference.

A little disappointed with Seminyak Beach after Kuta. No chairs on beach or options to have a cool drink while you watch the sun set. Every man and his dog there. Nothing spectacular about the sand or the water. Creek running into the beach made for a not-very-pleasant ambiance.

While I agree that this could be a beautiful beach to watch sunsets - this is the definition of dirty... Plastic waste as far as the eye can see. All you ever dreamt of in terms of plastic waste is available, yoghurt cups, plastic bags, syringes. And of course many other things like bottles etc. More than high time that local authoritiues ("guided" by the Tourism stakeholders) take decisive action.

If you like beaches and have the slightest bit of humanity DO NOT GO HERE!!

The beaches are disgusting you can not see the sand through the garbage! Like i said in previous posts i travel world wide with work and see much poorer places then Indonesia but I have never seen so much plastic on a beach in my life, it was heart breaking to see!

If you like hippy/back packing vibes them come here, otherwise stay clear it‚Äôs disgusting, no culture no nothing as offensive as this is to say, tourists (mainly Australians) have done what the British have done to parts of Spain, ruined it!

If you like culture and history move around Bali, yes it fine to be based here but you need to travel around

We stayed in Seminyak, I love the hotel where we stayed, loved that the beach is a great place to watch the sunset but....

the water is sooooo dirty. I didn‚Äôt even want to get my feet wet. I love the beach, but the water was so dirty I just swam in the hotel‚Äôs pool which I normally won‚Äôt do because I prefer saltwater.

Firstly I‚Äôd like to say the surrounding bars and rental places are all really nice, friendly and very affordable. It‚Äôs just a huge shame that the swell of the sea seems to accumulate so much rubbish onto the beach.

Surfing wise it‚Äôs great for beginners, lots of long white water waves to practise on and get your rhythm. It‚Äôs nice, but there‚Äôs far nicer beaches around Bali.

I was super excited to spend a week in Seminyak - until I hit the beach.
Disappointing! Garbage is everywhere (if ANY country wants to know we need to ban plastic bottles, go to this beach!) - dogs run the beach (and with dogs comes excrement) - and it was very crowded.
I did not enjoy swimming in garbage nor could I stomach walking around so much waste.
It is so sad. Such beauty being destroyed by so much trash.
If you are a beach person, or just enjoy a clean area, AVOID THIS BEACH!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,41,30>===============  
The sand is darkish, very fine & it sticks to you. Our hotel had a water tap to rinse your feet off before walking further. In front of our hotel, the Alila, the beach was clean & you did not get pestered to buy things. The waves were quite high when we were there, the red flags were up. Yes, there are noisey Clubs which can disturb the peace of the beach. I guess it depends on where you are on the beach. The sunsets are indeed beautiful. I found that early mornings on the beach were nice.

Okay to maybe spend an hour or so sipping a beer at this beach. It is not very clean and very crowded generally. It is a regular beach with no real beauty as such to enjoy. When it comes to Bali, there are far many, many more beaches that are much better.

Seminyak beach.
It's a beach.
It's darker sand due to volcanic activity
It sticks to you
There are facilities at various points but not well managed.
The food is ok at various points if you like pizza.
At night there are bands playing and comfy places to sit which is the highlight.
You can sit on it, it's a beach.

For once I preferred the pool which I don't very often do. Can't put my finger on why, perhaps it was a little too grungy, and I like grungy.

Better beaches;

Crete
Corfu
Frankston
Whitsunday
Hamilton island
Lake Patterson
Bondi
Carrum
Kos- kardamena
Zante.
The list goes on..... it was a pretty average beach I feel.

We had some drinks in La Plancha while watching the sunset and i also did my early morning walk in double six beach. I walked for 45 mins and i saw garbage ( plastic cups, straws, cans, toothpaste case, toothbrush, pet bottles and cover, rubber sandals ...) all over the beach.

I wanted to love this beach, I almost always choose the ocean over a swimming pool. Our hotel was directly in front of it, but I opted for the hotel pool 100% of the time for swimming & relaxing. I loved watching the surfing and everyone enjoying the water, but there was so much plastic and garbage on the beach it was unfortunate and made me not want to spend much time
there. It was certainly pretty from afar & very popular with locals and tourists alike.

We have visited Seminyak beach and were really horrified by how dirty it is and the amount of plastic all over the beach. It‚Äôs so upsetting to see piles of plastic all over the shore. I just wanted to pick it all up, but there is so much everywhere it would not have made a difference.
There are some lovely bars to watch the sunset from, however the view is ruined by the amount of plastic everywhere all around you.
We didn‚Äôt ever see anyone cleaning up the plastic at any point. We have seen many beautiful clean beaches in other parts of the world so this was a real shock. I would not visit this beach whilst it is in this mess.
Something seriously needs to be done about this situation and the poor environment :(

Sadly the beach has been used and not maintained, the rubbish is piled at the back of the beach and the sea is full of old plastic bags etc and who knows what else. The sufers seem to like it due to the high waves but for general swiming and bathing i would advise to choose another location.
I also think the locals and goverment could do more to help clean up the beach and surrounding areas. We moved on after a short stay and will not be returning.

I've been here a few times, and while I love the little beach cafes and seeing lots of people walking and the locals, it's not a beach I would swim in. There's a lot of rubbish along the waterline.

Lots of swim schools, but again, I wouldn't swim in the water.

The beach in Seminyak was a bit disappointed as although sandy the water was not very clear and the beach had a lot of debris around.

We visited for the sunset for a few times whilst in Seminyak: the colour of the sky is beautiful!

Not a great beach for sunbathing during the day as the sand is incredibly hot and the beach is covered in litter. Indonesia really does have a plastic pollution problem which ruins the feel of the beach. I've yet to find a good beach in Bali which is a shame.

That aside, check out the sunshine. Plenty of bars to sit in or bean bags to sit on and enjoy the view

We went there last week as soon as we landed in Bali.The beach is really relaxing and clean, perfect for a beach run or beach walk.

Finding a place to dine by the beach with some acoustic live music? Then you will love Seminyak like we do. My BF and I visited the beach for 4 consecutive nights at the same beach side stall for their amazing view, and live music. Stalls were set up on the beach itself , facing the sea and bean bag chairs were lay out with a table for dinning makes it even more relaxing. The staff were really friendly too.

Seminyak Beach was probably beautiful once. But not anymore. An early morning walk will reveal the beach and waters edge completely...yes completely...covered in plastic trash debris.
The poor labourers from beachfront posh hotels and the odd restaurant try valiantly to rake up this rubbish before the punters arrive expecting clean sand.
It is thoroughly depressing. An environmental catastrophy.
The walk behind the beachside cafes stinks and is full of litter.
As always the Balinese people are friendly and upbeat but how long can we all go on pretending this place is anything other than a polluted and ruined once-was-paradise.

Seminyak beach is black sand beach and the sea is generally clean to swim in. The best part of the beach is the sunset.

We had the chance to visit the beach at Seminyak. Our biggest surprise was to find the beach covered with rubbish. Plastic everywhere and no one seems to care.

Seminyak beach , a long greyish sand beach with endless swell atm. Not a lot of crowd and like everyone else, we're wondering where all the tourists are . Is Mt Agung and it's low rumbles keeping tourists away ? Suits us as we can have our pick of beach lounges , cold drinks at hand and out three year old grandson to entertain us while his Daddy surfs.Bosrd hire seems cheap but our boy has his one of his own , designed for North Narrabeen but handling Bali's surf beautifully .Horse riding along the beach too and not much sign of the litter problem we'd be warned about .

As far as beaches go, this has got to be the worst beach l have ever seen. I was her a year previous and returned to see if it had been cleaned since, it had not.
It had raw sewage coming down a river which continues to flow down the river a year later. There were no white horses in the sea but brown horses of sewage. Coming to Bali for this beach would be a big mistake.

As an Aussie, I was unaware that you had to pay for a shaded seat - although I do recommend it in on a hot summers day. Although it‚Äôs a little expensive for Indonesian standards, it will make your time on the beach a little more enjoyable. You will encounter lots of locals trying to sell you sunnies, hazard, jewellery and other nick nacks. Just kindly reject their offers and enjoy the beautiful view.

The place is so dirty I don't know how anyone can want to come here! We stayed in Seminyak for 4 nights thinking it would be a beach holiday but we took one look at the beach and we couldn't understand how this place is advertised as a beach destination.

The waves are so high and rough you cannot swim in the sea, and the sand has so much rubbish it's disgusting. Poor wildlife! Such a shame.

Even large 5 star resort hotels didn't seem to care to clean up the patch of sand that their hotels overlook.

We ended up sending the 4 nights in Seminyak around a pool. Will not be returning.

There is no escaping beach sellers, with sarongs, paintings and other trinkets with thier well rehearsed "I give you good deal"
The beach is littered with rubbish, broken glass and other not so friendly beach items.
During the day its hot, with some what rough conditions.
The beach offers direct walking access to Kuta in the south, or Potato Head in the north.
At night the beach comes alive with bean bags, colourful umbrellas and beach dining.
Definitely go explore and make your own decision. For me, its not a swimming beach.

We have been a regular visiter to the beach over many years and little has changed. Hawkers in plenty but once you no how to handle them they add to the scene. BINTANG is cold and offered at a cheap price so grab a beer relax and enjoy the sunset.

I've been to this part of Bali for 5/6 times over the years but I was horrified to see how polluted this beach has become this time. It really has no reason to visit anymore unless the local government acts immediately and strenuously to curb use of plastic packaging on the island. I also found injection needle on the beach but when I handed it to a guy who was cleaning he didn't seem to be too care about what I found, which might reflect such found was nothing unusual. I'll go elsewhere instead of Bali or at least this part of Bali anyway.

This is the dirtiest beach I‚Äôve seen in Bali so far. They clean it regularly but still there is a lot of garbage.
Good for surfers-beginners. Sand and small waves (white water). No good schools nearby though (at least I haven‚Äôt come across).
There is a lot of bars on this beach. The ones that are close to the entrance are very expensive, the further the cheaper. There are people trying selling you goods but not a lot of them and they pass if you ignore them.

First time we went down to the beach, there was a lot of trash on the beach. Maybe thrown up by some rough seas, but it was a little disconcerting to have to step over it. Now it appears there has been some effort to clear it up, but some still remains.

It didn't impact our stay at all, but worth noting. Look past that, and it's still beautiful.

We went for a walk on Seminyak beach 2 days ago and were horrified to find how filthy and littered with rubbish it was.

Went here in February and left immediately, but not before paying the extortionate price of 100k for a sun lounger and being harassed by multiple women selling sarongs etc. The beach was filthy, littered in plastic and the sea was full of plastic too - my boyfriend literally came out with food wrappers stuck to his body.

What a tip during this time of year, could not believe our eyes first morning we ventured down to walk the beach rubbish strewn as far as you could see just as many other travellers pics have shown , INDONESIA get your act together this is disgraceful , we are told 'its all from Java " due to the stormy weather around this time of year REALLY? .

Went for a day during low season (January), when it's said that trade winds wash a fair amount of pollution into the area. The beach itself was filthy - could have used a good cleaning.

This beach has a scenic view , surrounded my multiple shacks but unfortunately not maintained.

You see garbage lying all around, shacks aren't clean and hygienic , there were no sea guards....

There were no swings- which is like the usp of Bali !

Overall I suggest can be avoided !

As beaches go the walk from Semiyak, past Legian to Kuta isn‚Äôt the most pleasant.
The positive: Beach bars galore semiyak end with cheap beer and entertainment at sunset! However if you are specifically describing the beach huge amounts of rubbish wash up, I‚Äôve read on travel blogs this is a problem this time of year but I was surprised at the sheer amount. Every man and his dog wants to teach you to surf however I can imagine there are nicer places to do this. I for one look forward to travelling to more remote locations in search of the white sandy beautiful beaches I without hesitation know exist on this beautiful island.

Seminyak beach is a great place ti spend an evening with friends relaxing on a bean bag sipping drinks, having a nibble and chatting with friends. Great atmephere to just sit back and chill. Music can be loud. Pick your favourite bar and sit back. Enjoy a sunset if there's no cloud. We missed out. 2 weeks of cloud cover.
Day time take a swim but expect debri on beach coming in with the tides. Water is warm. Dont expect white sandy beaches as it is dark grey volcanic sand.

We went here to have some beer at night time and chill. Although it was a windy day, they beach was fine but the water of the beach were too far from the shore, its nice to sit back and relax here while drinking, it wasnt crowded at all and there were no vendors bugging me unlike in Kuta beach there are too many people forcing us to buy something! but it was a little dirty and its sand was dark grey, unlike in pandawa and padang padang beach which has white sand..

It's tough to write a review for an entire beach. Even tougher to write about a constantly changing thing... so let me paint broad strokes: Seminyak beach is brown-sugar sand that is best experienced May-Oct -- off-shore wind, dry season, sun, surf, hustle&bustle and of course: epic sunsets.

Useless to say ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be bothered by locals who try to sell you stuff‚Äù because that is written in every single review of Bali, get over it, that‚Äôs what they do to get money.
The beach is BEAUTIFUL, and the best thing I can advice you to do is to go there to watch the sunset, as it really warms your heart.

Seminyak Beach is part of a very long breach that runs from Echo Beach in the North to Kuta in the South. It runs for MANY Kilometres (I'd guess 10Km, at least). The Beach is wide and easy to walk along. Surfing is mainly at the North end (Canggu area). For Western tastes, the Beach is not attractive or inviting. It is a "dirty" grey colour and more literally "dirty" from a LOT of rubbish on it. There are many areas set-aside for Hotel guests with Sun Shading and deck chairs. these areas are no cleaner, otherwise, the water and beachfront, are available to all. Be prepared to be approached by many vendors! For sun-bathers, the beach, in the Hotel areas, is fine. For Beach-walkers/runners, it's also fine. For Swimmers, it's up to your preference of "clean" water.

I am going to be slightly negative about this beach, unfortunately. I heard a lot about this beach before I went and I was left disappointed. The sunsets, however, were magnificent every evening, but the beach itself was not to my liking. Coming from Australia, where we have such clean and beautiful beaches, I am left to compare my beaches to that standard.

Seminyak beach was overcrowded with beach umbrellas and lounges for tourists. I realise this is normal for this time of year (January). But what disappointed me the most was the rubbish. There were tonnes of man-made rubbish scattered along the beach with no attempt by local authorities to clean it up. With the little attempt made by local shopkeepers to clean up, it was stored on the foreshore for the tide to take away. I can only imagine what Kuta beach would have been like.

It was certainly a different experience. Seminyak Beach in Bali was unique, but for me, it's a place I really won't return to anytime soon.

We visited this beach every day in December it was very quiet as it was December. The people were amazing on the beach. The most disappointing thing was the accumulation of rubbish all day long that washed in from the sea. Some of the locals cleared it up first thing and then it was washed in again, a never ending task. It put me off this beach and sea as it seemed very dirty.

This beach is beautiful and has lots of great waves if you're into surfing. Also great if you're a first time surfer they have tons of affordable surfing lessons and the waves are great but not so intense that it's a hard place to learn.

There are great little beachfront restaurants and bars, and it's pretty easy to get a lounge chair if you go early enough. Negotiate for it and don't pay more than 50-100K rupiah for 2-3 hours.

Sadly, there is a lot of trash on this beach. So walking along the water is not a great experience because you're dodging washed up trash and plastic bags.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,54,10>===============  
Ok straight up here...the beach is horrible. Why you ask...ill tell you...its polluted with rubbish that gets washed up due to the rainy season or due to tourists leaving waste on the beach. Every morning we watched locals tirelessly try to remove rubbish, youd come back the next day and it would all start again. Maybe were spot with our australian beaches and ecpectations that all beaches should look like ours but this was really sad. Of more concern was that young children were allowed by parents to run tgrough the litter without a care in the world. I can tell you know there is no way i would tramp through the litter to fet to the water let alone alliw a child too. I wouldnt even enter the waters on this beach its just not worth it.

Its not all gloom though. Late acternoon tge restarants open up and you can have some great dri ks and meals on yhe beach watching the sunset. Most cafes have their own music and the food is good (id recommend trying b9b we fou d them the best). Go have a look at Semenyak beach but dont be mislead by images showing you thats its a pristine haven youll be dissapointed.

The beach is nice and has a good stretch if you would like to walk. Usually in the evening the tide increases. Couldnt see any lifeguards nor is a beach for swimming as the water did not look very clean. Overall my recommendation would be to chill at the beach clubs/hotel facing the sea and not bother swimming in the sea - use the infinity pools out there.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,55,30>===============  
The beach is not very clean and the food stalls near the beach aren't very hygienic. If you have access to the beach through some villas r resorts then that portion of the beach is a must visit

So the 5 of us, (hubby and 3 kids and I) went for a walk on the beach around 6pm. The tide was out and all we could see was rubbish. There was so much rubbish on the beach being washed up, it was really sad to see.
There were people everywhere and it just like it was so normal to them.
It would be nice to maybe have more bins on the beach and make the locals and tourists aware of how bad it is to litter on the beach. Not only for the looks of the beach but also for the sea life.
At breakfast the next day in our resort, I asked the manager if it was ever cleaned.
He told me that the beach was cleaned every night. WOW- I was surprised.
During that morning, we went for another walk and there was minimal rubbish. (Sadly, it was there again every night, but that did not stop the people coming in. )
The waves looked amazing and many people were enjoying themselves surfing, swimming etc.
We decided to just swim in the pool instead.
The sand in front of The Royal Beach Resort was very grey, not the sand I expected. Nor, was it any good for making Sand Castles.
Still a nice view though.

This photo is more towards Seminyak where the sand got a better.
This was also during the day.

Oh Seminyak, your streets in general were so well maintained but the public beach strip was a disgrace. I know that we were there in rainy season and the sea throws up more garbage than usual, but watching the tourist hordes also treat the beach like a dumping ground and only a few bars/hotels making an effort to clean up was extremely disappointing. I've lived and worked in Asia in similarly touristy destinations and this is the worst I've seen in a long time. Friends staying further along the coast had an entirely different experience so that's reassuring but we didn't even swim in the sea because of this. Bali, you are a beautiful island with beautiful people, culture and food. Please don't forget the beaches (and kick the butts of tourist litter louts!).

After staying a week at Seminyuk in a villa behind the W hotel, I spent each day walking/running between 8 and 14kms on the beach,
The early sunrise views were beautiful, the air clean and fresh and you feel a million dollars when out and walking.
The problem is the pollution, there are 3 streams that run onto the beach and the water stinks of sewerage when you walk through these streams.
In addition to the water stink was the huge amount of plastic garbage on the beach as well as broken glass , I didn‚Äôt feel safe to walk on the beach without shoes on.
The Bali and Indonesian government officials need to work out how to reduce the plastic waste and the open sewerage that runs onto the beach, it will really impact the tourists coming over if like me they feel the water is not clean to swim in.

There are many resorts near this beach and quite a few restaurants right on the beach with lawn chairs facing the water. There is less trash than on kuta beach, mostly just a little more effort to keep it clean but still trash around.

We stayed at Double Six, with a beach front balcony. The beach is nearly always lively. New Year‚Äôs Eve the front street is mayhem, which if you love Bali you‚Äôll be used to!
We went to the rooftop club and watched the fireworks along the bay, amazing.
The beach it self has a rubbish \ garbage problem, some say due to it being the wet season the garbage is wash down streams into the sea. Early morning groups clean the beach every day, but to no avail as later in the day the garbage is back.
The water is murky and you feel garbage washing around you.

Some hawkers, but not too pushy.

Pricing in bars is on the high side, for Bali.

There are nicer beaches in Bali for surfing and relaxing, the area does have a great selection of good restaurants though, and sunsets are good anywhere on the west side of the island.

I stayed in Seminyak area and went to the beach for a run on around 8:30 AM. What I saw was shocking. The beach is full of rubbish and filth. Never seen a beach this bad even in India. Check out the photos. Clearly, this rubbish was not thrown by the beachgoers. It is washed out from somewhere else. It seems to me that Bal does not have a garbage collection/disposal system so everything ends up in the ocean. There was large cleaning crew with large machines trying to clean up. But whatever they do, all goes back to ocean. I had a very different impression about Bali before I went there. Old historical temples such as Lempuyang Temple are worth a visit, not the seminyak beach. Save time and go somewhere else.

Ok, it is the rainy season and it drag a lot of dirt to the beach and in the water. The plus is that you can find your place and the merchants on the beach are few and polite.

This is a pleasant place to lie and sunbath.The view is great as well and it is a good place to learn surfing. Yet as there are waves you might prefer another place for a dip.

The last time that we visited was in 2009....fast forward to 2018 and the place has been cleaned up away from the beach. The restaurants and the shopping areas are not modern and a lot cleaner. The shop keepers do not pester you to purchase, if you want to look and buy then you are able to do so in peace. The beach itself we visited and there was a lot of rubbish on the beach. Given that it was just after New Years Eve this may have be part of the reason. I will be back in the future for sure.

I have yet to see this beach in pristine condition. Admittedly there is some attempt to clean up the pile of plastic that stretches the length of the beach but this is only done in the areas which are set back from the waters edge. Moreover the workers use rudimentary equipment are they appear lazy.
Depending upon the time of year there can be dangerous rip currents so bathing beach flags should be followed at all times.

Had higher expectation of the beach but the waters edge was covered in plastic rubbish making it uncertain of what we were walking on and definitely did not make a swim inviting - beach in desperate need of a cleanup

The beach itself is truly BEAUTIFUL
We surfed there - the waves are perfect for beginners BUT: when we were there the beach and water was full of trash. What a pity. They reacted well and started cleaning right away as it seemed to be bigger problem (trash came apparantly from indonesian mainland/other island)
Of course Bali is not alone to blame for this problem - yet truly something needs to be done or Bali will have a big Problem with tourism.

The beach can get dirty but the get cleaners to clean it. The nightlife along the beach is buzzing. Alila has a great bar where you can listen to waves crashing. It is magical. Take a stroll on the beach. I did not have a dip but looking at the ocean at this beach was great.

Seminyak Beach has many entry points. We entered from the Polis Post in Seminyak (you can enter through Ku De Ta too) or one of the villas or hotels facing the beach. Compared to Kuta Beach, this beach is relatively free of rubbish, water sports touts and people. It begins to get crowded with people when you are walking on the beach approaching where Ku De Ta Restaurant is.

The water sports costs are more expensive too. In Kuta, you pay 50,000 rupiah per person (after bargaining) for 2 hours of the surf board; but in Seminyak it is 80,000 rupiah per person for 2 hours. The beach vendors on the beach served better food though. We did not feel like eating on the beach so we bought some satay (meat on skewers), fried banana pancakes and meatball soup. The food only cost us 40,000! The banana pancakes are 2,000 rupiahs each and the meat satay only 1,000 each! Unbelievably true.

Such a disappointment. The beach is guilty! Humans being at fault! Plastic rubbish every where. Beach vendors clean their patch constantly. But the next wave carries in more plastic. The sea is full of it!

We dropped by Seminyak Beach to see what all the fuss is about. Don‚Äôt be misled - those sands are far from White. If you‚Äôre looking for beaches of an Australian standard - knowing we are incredibly spoiled by beautiful sands and water - head to Nusa Dua Beach instead.

The beach was beautiful. The sea was quite rough so great for water sports but not so much for swimming. The only downside was the constant hassle from people selling things. If you say ‚Äúno thank you‚Äù they do generally leave you alone. Loungers and parasol available to rent but don‚Äôt take the first price, we fell for this on the first day and paid 200k rp for two loungers, on the second day we walked down the beach slightly and paid just 100k.

I don't know what has happened in Bali but their beaches are full of rubbish. It is deep with plastic bags, bottles and general waste in the ocean and especially on the beach.

The only thing that made Seminyak beach a bit better is that they had tractors working furious trying to collect it. Unfortunately as the ocean is full of rubbish, it just kept filling up.

Tuban, Kuta and other beaches including Canggu were atrocious as this clean up wasn't happening as well as Seminyak. It really is disgraceful as the only way that much rubbish could be in the ocean is if it was being dumped.

At any rate until this gets cleaned up or there dumping practises change I wouldn't recommend their beaches. This was like this at the start of our holiday and it was just as bad when we left.

Shame really.

Not a swimming beach. Loads of trash in the water and washed up. In the more tourist sections they have loungers and do clear away the rubbish, but we took one look and knew this wasn‚Äôt a place to come and sunbathe/relax/swim. Go to a beach club... or a nicer beach.

Seminyak Beach is one of the cleaner and more inviting beaches I‚Äôve visited in Bali (mainland Bali that is, the Gilis and Lombok have amazing beaches) and I enjoyed a few long walks and a swim with family. The surf is good for body boarding and catching waves as well (though don‚Äôt drink and swim if you‚Äôre inexperienced, my brother had to pull a guy out of the water who could have drowned). The water was nice and I didn‚Äôt encounter rubbish like I have before further south at Legian (there was a tiny creek flowing into the ocean to cross which was a bit dirty but that was all) and there weren‚Äôt many sellers or hawkers at the section where we stayed (just near Potato Head, Alila & Mrs Sippy bars). If you can get a hotel or villa in this area you‚Äôd do well as it‚Äôs not too overcrowded and it‚Äôs a quality stretch of beach close to some excellent restaurants and bars.

If you are in Bali then do visit Seminyak beach. It is good long beach and it is neat and clean. There are water sports, beach chairs/beds for rent and several food and beverages options.

Unless you've never been to a nice beach before, you will surely be disappointed and underwhelmed. The sand is not pretty and the water is not blue. I'm honestly very surprised that Seminyak is such a popular destination. There is absolutely nothing special about the beach there. If you told me I was at a New Jersey beach I would have believed you.

Seminyak beach is the best beach Bali has, especially the northern side (Batubelig)....it is flat and wide...and moderate waves in the morning. Sunset could be good in clear weather. Very nice for morning walk from Kudeta to Potato Head Club.

It‚Äôs a long stretch of sand but there is no white sand & more rubbishy than should ever be present on a beach!

Wet Season is around October to March, (ish) at this time Indonesia rains and storms a lot. This brings out all the trash and rubbish and covers the beach in gunk. I was swimming and every wave that came past me I was brushed up by chip packets, plastic wrappers, and so on. The beach itself has barley any motoring which means it could be very dangerous to bring little kids. As I almost got caught it a strong rip, it made me realise there was minimal noticeable life guards or safety plans in place.

There are many people on the beach selling you cool nicknacks (strange items). Only issue is they can be very persistent and will not leave you alone until you buy something. I personally felt uncomfortable leaving my bag on the beach while the ladies were lurking around. So I had to stay with my earphones in ignoring them until they finally walked away.

Our second day on the beach was a real treat, we went left instead of right which wasn't pleasant at all. So do remember to go left from Seminyak onto the beach.

There are woman who give massages on the beach, and people selling all sorts of goodies.

This beach reminded me a little bit of my home country of Wales Uk
Cloudy skies , dark (almost dirty looking) sand , and the sea didn't look inviting either!
The bars with their bean bags and umbrellas were pretty and would have liked to have been there on a dry sunnier day and even for sunset as then this would have been better.
Was expecting whiter sands in Bali but not this one.
Such a shame , maybe next time it will look better

Went to this beach for a stroll in the evening and to enjoy sunset on my first day in Bali. It's definitely got a good footfall, yet clean and serene. So many shacks line up this beach with colourful bean bags on the beach to sleep and enjoy the view and drinks. The sunset is stunning.

We come from a country which is known for it's beaches yet we enjoyed the Seminyak beach very much.

The walk from Mr Potato Head beach club to Kuta will take around one hour unless you dally. Do the walks in the morning if you are an early riser to avoid the heat that comes with the sun. Don't forget that you need to walk back.Lovely walk on firm sand and wonderfully pleasant waves lapping at your feet. The walk in the heat of the day will be more strenuous so do wear a sunhat and do coverup and decidedly, slip, slap, slop on the suntan lotion.
During the morning, the sun lounges and beach umbrellas appear as people arrive to sun and swin. The beach clubs and beach bars that spread all along the beach will serve drinks and snacks and some even serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. Later in the afternoon, as the heat begins to dissipate, the locals arrive with children and dogs and the appearance of the beach changes. There will be games of soccer played near the water, babies will be laughing as the waves lap at their little legs. Lots of pretty girls taking selfies and almost as many couples doing the same. Guys watching the girls and girls watching the boys. The occasional dog believing it is human will lie down in the water and let the waves wash over it. Surfers gliding on the frothy waves and the odd fishing boat out at sea dot the panorama. As the light fades, live music can be heard from beach bars. Singers set up on mini stages with back to the sea face multicoloured bean bags hosting resting locals and tourists sipping drinks, chatting and chilling out. Later, after the music has stopped and the beach goers have gone and went the scene changes yet again. The odd surfer is still out there surfing the glittering silver sea but the sand is almost deserted except for the odd couple strolling hand in hand. Sun lounges, beach umbrellas and bean bags have been washed and put away and only rubbish remains which like magic, disappears by morning.

We didn't spend time lying on the beach here. Unfortunately stray dogs seem to be a real issue in Bali and they roam freely on the beach doing their business where they like with nobody to clean up after them! Not ideal. There was some litter lying about and in the water which was disappointing.

We couldn't let our children walk barefoot in the sand, and we all were completely put off swimming, thinking the water was likely dirty as well.
I write this review hoping that the local council and/or the beachfront businesses can organize ongoing cleanup and pollution prevention for the area, as that beach is a major tourist draw.

This is a wide long stretch of beach. There are many beach bars along most of the stretch, all with bean bags, tables, most having live music nightly, and serving cocktails beers etc.
There are a lot of street traders prowling the beach, many of whom don‚Äôt like to take ‚Äúno‚Äù for an answer. They can be quite intrusive if you are trying to have a conversation.
If the clouds are right, the sunsets on this beach are not to be missed, cameras at the ready, you will get some great shots here.

First opinions when we got down there was very muddy and a lot of rubbish lying around,
but when we got onto the beach itself it wasn't bad at all, they are building the sea wall and it is very nice and very arty, would love to see it when it's completed and everything is built up by hand.
lovely walk across the beach but even when it's not to sunny, please put some sun cream as you will catch it, even if you don't think you will, be safe, stopped in a couple of bars on the beach and again impressed, the only thing that put me off was there are dogs roaming around and what put me off was one had a dump right alongside where we walked from the bar to the sea, nobody around the bar areas (owners) picked it up and disposed of it, we soon disappeared back off the beach, there are no laws about pets or strays on the beach but I would have thought the bar tenders who was watching at the time could have done something and I also know they have to go somewhere, apart from that nice clean beach once you are on it.

The beach is really long, so perfect for early morning walks. Lots to see along the way with loads of hotels spotted it length. Loads of beach bars as well. The sand is nice and clean and water refreshing...... but remember to swim between the flags as they do have areas with rips.

We went here late afternoon in April. great vibe, people playing football, jogging, shacks were busy but not overcrowded. We read a rubbish near the beach and had low expectations but were pleasantly surprised, it was very clean. Beautiful sunset spot. Evening walk near the beach is a must!

Popular, good waves for beginner surfers. A small amount of litter but not overwhelming. Beds under umbrellas for which you need to negotiate a price.

The waves were astonishing. The men on the beach who offer day beds are genuine and accommodating. Not a lot of garbage but I suspect that may change as there isn't a dedicated person to clean it. Overall great location with beautiful sand and waves

Seminyak is pretty hectic but the beach is wide and you will find a decent spot to relax on. The more north you go, the more quiet it is. The water is pretty wavy and the sunsets are beautiful.

Perhaps because of the pending Volcano eruptions, Seminyak Beach was deserted. There were some shops on the shore but nothing eye-catching, and the sand, unlike Kuta Beach, was dark and coarse.

The beach is amazing. It‚Äôs everything you‚Äôd expect from Bali. The sandy beaches are wide, and it stretches for miles.

We went there a couple of times in the evening to watched the sunset and it was near our hotel. I‚Äôm not sure if this beach is good for swimming but it is good enough for a stroll along the beach in the evening and to watch sunset.

The atmosphere along this beach at night is what Bali is all about! The bands, the drinks, the food and the bean bags all add up to a fun relaxing end to your day, Or a great start to your night. Either way, if you're in Seminyak you must go down to the beach and spend sometime enjoying what they have to offer down there. Keep up the good work!

A disgustingly dirty beach full of trash! I would never in my right mind spend time at the beach yet alone swim there!! It was bad 7 years ago when we first visited Bali, now it's just purely disgusting!

seminyak beach , is one of the best beaches in bali, we went there for a day trip, and was amazed how clean is the beach, a lot of people are surfing, and many water sports.

Had my sons wedding in Bali, so relaxing, looking forward to going again. Balinese folk so welcoming, shopping and restaurants a hive of activity.

The beach at Seminyak is not its finest feature. At certain states of the tide there can be rubbish and rain in the hills can wash natural rubbish down the small streams that cross the beach. There is a fairly steep shelve in certain areas which means that you should watch small children but the proliferation of surf schools means that there are experience people on hand at all times. Red flags seem to mean nothing
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,69,40>===============  
The water and the beaches are really very clean. Although haven't seen a lot of surfers but still come ppl did learn there as the waves are small. The beach has all amenities like shacks, restaurant with live bands in the night, private beach clubs and shops around to buy anything u want from beer to medicines.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,69,40>===============  
It's a very nice beach to watch the sunset. It's very popular under the locals as well.

Swimming is dangerous and the beaches are not the cleanest but even with that you can have a nice (long) walk.

Only big disadvantage I found is that a water out of the city ends up into the sea at different points and it's hard to continue your way without putting at least 1 feet into it.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,69,40>===============  
Beautiful beach and could be more beautiful, if people did their part and picked up after themselves. We need to keep our oceans and land clean. This area is a little more quiet then Kuta and Legian. My new favourite spot.

I used to love coming here to sit on the beach and enjoy sunbathing or watching the sunset.

I came this month with my friends and was disgusted by the rubbish found on the beach from start to finish. It was filled with plastic bottles, tin cans, plastic bags, cigarette packets and other rubbish.

This is not suitable for children, fish or the environment. It‚Äôs disgusting and I‚Äôm appalled this is the condition it‚Äôs been left in.

Great for Long walks. Long stretch of sand. Cleaner than expected. Fantastic sunsets. Go to the Breeze at the Samanta hotel for a drink at sunset. Amazing seating and views.

Great day for just sitting under a umbrella having a few drinks with friends
Many restaurants across the road to enjoy lunch then enjoy the rest of the day relaxing with music drinks and good company intill the sunsets
Beach sellers make it more interesting with buying gifts that after a few beers you may never of bought but very cheap just makes the experience and you can have a little fun.
Worth a visit to make the holiday experience.

Seminyak Beach is lovely. It's fairly clean although it could do with some rubbish bins along the way as I picked up a couple of bits of trash but couldn't find anywhere to put them! The sand is lovely and the water was warm every time we got in. We didn't surf but it looked fantastic for that and easy and affordable to hire a board or get a lesson. There are lots of beach front hotels and restaurants and the views are just always gorgeous!

The beach was a good place to surf, but it is the beach to watch that the tide is in for that. If you go to a shop you will pay 1ml per person for a lesson, but we got a lesson from the boys on the beach and it was a very good one for 500k for the two of us and we had a trainer each.

Beers and other drinks are very cheap on the beach

Ok I stayed here. Nice place just giving you a review of the actual beach....it's. it that nice. For example just north of Potatoem Head beach club it is littered with rubbish (My kids refused to swim at Seminyak). Not sure if the currents push this up form the south beaches. Kuta and Legian are nicer beaches. Kuta is jam packed with locals trying to sell you something so it may be this reason that people are moving awAy from Kuta beach. Legian is pretty good .... clean and much less locals trying to sell you things. If you are thinking of having a rest on the beach best to take your sunnies off and close your eyes and that way the locals leave you all ne
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,72,40>===============  
Really nice long and deep beach. Don't expect spectacular beauty - not really blue seas or really white sands. Great sun and places to stop for a drink. Some litter on the beach and a slightly off putting stream running near the restaurants.

LOTS of people wandering around selling stuff and the typical trying to hustle tours off of tourists .... it is excessive

this is a SURFING beach and the balinese kids were killing it this AM

With the bars facing the sea and bean bags on the beach, we were spoilt for choice. There are also umbrellas with sunbeds for rent.
We preferred Seminyak Beach to Kuta Beach. It is obviously less crowded, and sellers do not harass you much, except for a few of them who approach you selling pareos, accessories and paintings. Besides that, it was a very peaceful day out under the sun.
We spent the whole day on the beach having beer after beer til sundown. Nice waves, nice water, it was perfect!
The beach was clean which is important. We reckon the staff from the beach clubs are instructed to keep the beach clean to keep customers coming back. Music and the sound of waves crashing on the beach was the perfect combination while getting a tan or over a game of cards.
If you want a less crowded & cleaner beach, choose this beach over Kuta Beach anyday.

A beautiful stretch of beach, offering an abundance of bars along the way, meaning you can stop anywhere to enjoy an ice cold Bintang whilst watching the amazing show that is a Bali sunset.

For anyone looking for a great beach to spend a few hours, or the whole day at when in Bali you can‚Äôt go past Seminyak Beach. Day or night, it‚Äôs colourful, fun & totally beautiful. Food & drinks are available from the beachfront cafes, Juice Park is my fav, or from the friendly locals who serve you right at your sun lounge (which you can hire for an hour or the whole day very cheap). Make it a ‚Äòmust do‚Äô in the night to buy a lantern from the local sellers on the beach (they will help you light it) & make a wish as you watch it rise up into the night sky..... very special

I had been told the beaches in Seminyak were stunning so I tagged a few days here onto the end of my trip. I was slightly disappointed (and shocked) at how dirty they were though.

I walked along the beach for an hour or so collecting shells before finding a beach bar to sit and watch the sunset. In that time I saw a lot of accompanied and unaccompanied dogs ..... and with dogs comes s**t. I saw more of it on the beach than I've seen on any other beach anywhere. Not impressed.

In addition to the doggie issue, there were used nappies and general litter scattered all over the place. There's no excuse for this and I just kept walking until I found the clean stretch I decided to settle at for the sunset. Needless to say I was very careful where I stepped on my walk back towards town....
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,74,40>===============

My husband is a keen surfer and loved surfing at the beach. I just went to sun bath and relax which was nice. Not many families swimming at beach as waves quite big (is a known surf beach).

The beach is really great with waves for the board riders either just starting out learning, or for the more experienced .
There's heaps and heaps of people trying to flog anything they can. What was disappointing was the hawkers are teaching their young and very young kids how to do it..very off putting..

Great to walk along in the early mornings, don't be afraid of the dogs .. as they don't go near you at all! no swimming at this beach, as in SEP 17, too many rips didnt allow. Hubby dipped in quickly but found it to be extremely salty. Nice to look at, nice to walk along and that's it.

Back when I was at primary school I remember seeing a to programme ('Watch') that featured Bali and it looked like paradise. Long time ago that but I'm now here at Seminyak Beach. Perhaps not the place it was back then and although nice enough I have visited many many more attractive beaches.
Sand is lovely and fine but volcanic so quite dark in colour. It's a huge expanse of sand with little natural shade but there are rows an rows of sun beds with umbrellas like in Italy which I don't like. Hence for me it's paradise lost
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,75,30>===============  
We strolled along the beach in the late afternoon, with the tide well out. There were a lot of people on the beach, but not many in the water. The sand was a grayish colour and we had to step in smelly drain water on two occasions, which is obviously more apparent at low tide.

Lovely beach with warm water and not to many traders. My only issue is the lack of dustbins and a place where you can wash after swimming, at the very least there must be a small tap where you can rinse off your feet.

We went down here walked along beach the sand isn't the pure white more a chocolate with shells. It is flagged for swimming and it was rough the red flags indicate a rip be careful. There isn't a lot on this beach which is good the water wasn't cold. It's ok

Do not go to Bali beach expecting Golden Sands. Seminyak Beach is no exception, the beach is clean and the water warn, surf is ok but that's where it ends. Vendors set up beach beds and hawk them for 100,000ir for 2 . Then once...More

Seminyak beach has to be on any Bali checklist. The Sunsets are super colourful with the umbrellas of La Plancha adding up to the scene! Good music, cocktails and vibes overall at the beach.

This was a good beach for us because we wanted to do some surfing as beginners and we're looking for consistent waist deep foamy waves and sand all the way out. This was a better bet for us than the beach at Canggu where the surf was too messy for beginners in August. There may be somewhere better for beginner surfers...

Surf board hire 200,000 idr for 2 hours for 2 boards and rash vests

It stays shallow here for some way out but the waves can get quite big. Not so good for swimming.

The beach isn't the cleanest but only in the respect that there is the same run off into the sea as you unfortunately find on other Bali beaches. Unfortunately, like many beaches in Bali you will also find lots of polystyrene balls chocking the sand from the burst beach bean bags put out for tourists to use.

We were greeted by the locals offering the beach beds. We chose one with 100,000 Rupiah for 2 beds. The beach was clean. Everyone was friendly. It is definitely not as crowded as Kuta. The beach is a good place for those who prefer lesser noise and disturbance.

If you're expecting beautiful white beaches and swaying palm trees forget it. Instead you get dirty sand (and the sea doesn't look too clean either). No change rooms or toilets, and just about the entire length signposted "for surfers only". If you want to go in and cool off no choice but to ignore the signs. Loads of tacky souvenir shops, eateries and bars plus outrageous prices to hire the deckchairs. On the other hand lots of "Bali watches" for sale, some of which might even still be working once you get back on the plane!

It is over 35 years since I last visited Bali and I could not get over the transformation. The sellers on the beach were more controlled - they did not hassle - just there in the background and would descend only if encouraged. It actually meant you could enjoy the beach. A big contrast from when I was last there

We stayed in Seminyak for a week and absolutely loved the beach! We walked the beach every morning before visiting another area. We also spent a couple of days lounging on the beach with coconut water or a mixed drink. Beautiful beach, beautiful view. It was a little dirty and didn't have any garbage cans.

The beech is well maintained with lots of local hawkers adding to the ambience. Hire a beach couch and watch the waves roll in with a Bintang or grab some surfing lessons. The beach hawkers will sell you (try to sell you) lots of stuff you don't need but that's part of the scene here. Sunset anywhere along the beach is great. Only a short stroll to the Seminak Village Square.

The beach and place is close to the airport.Take an uber to the main Street and walk to the place.Its surrounded by good restaurants like ke de ta and potato head to chill in.Though highly priced if you are going to spend hours at the place ,then it's worth it.
The beach is clean with lovely water.The day we visited the water seemed a bit rough but we did go in for a swim.
Be carefull the sand shifts with the water.
You would loungers at the beach which can be hired for two hours for 200000 IDR.
the restaurants have there own showers and towels If you need them,otherwise there are public showers too.

Beautiful beach, nice waves
Not much water sports available, basic parasailing, banana boats are available, No jet ski
The route to the beach through the Four point hotel is about 300-500m
Gets pretty dark by 7pm, suggest to go earlier.
Water gets cold by 6pm onwards

For a nice quiet soak in the sun and some simple swimming its the ideal beach for you.

Dark, fine volcanic sand beach. Wide expanse at low tide. Great sunset views.
Red flag signals a no-swimming zone, due to the strong current.

A nice place to sit at relax but I would not go swimming as between La Lucciola Restaurant and the car park there is a stormwater sewage canal that enters the beach and the sea, how ever if you go down to the beach for the sunset grab a drink and a fresh corn sit on the beach and relax

Really nice beach located a 5-10 min walk from seminyak sq. lots of things to do, hire a surf board for an hour (50k-100k) hire a body board (~50k) do a surf lesson for an hour (200k and we got to keep the board for an extra hour). We also had sundowners outside the anantara hotel which were great. Very reasonably priced drinks for what is an excellent location to watch the sun slip into the sea on some rather comfy beanbags!

But not to swim in ... rips and currents make it too unsafe to do so. A very long stretch of beach which allows you to look at the other hotels on the beach.

For some reason, I delayed travel to Indonesia despite visiting so many other countries in SEAsia, some more than once. Now that I have finally experienced Bali's Seminyak Beach area, it has suddenly reached the top of the pyramid. It is my new First Choice destination. The beach is very wide. The sand is fine and glistens in the sun. The ocean winds seem constant and is refreshing from the heat. Shelling is possible in a few areas but don't expect much on that front. The surf is robust but far more so to the north. Hotels, resorts, beach cafes and on-the-beach bars are prolific. There's a few very, very polite beach peddlers who are not at all pushy. It's a superb area any beach lover.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,79,50>===============  
You got multiple options 1. Sit on a bean bag and have a drink 2. Sit on casual dining tables So many restaurants to select from with nice price and quality food. $10-$15 for a meal for two
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,79,50>===============  
Huge beach with a great atmosphere. It's very clean and lovely comfortable sun beds (200k IDR for the day)
The waves are quite strong so not really for swimming, but great to enjoy messing around in the surf.
Without a doubt the best time of day to visit is late afternoon - there is a great laid back atmosphere and the beach offers amazing views of the sunset.
There are lots of bars along the beach - all with beanbags where you can relax and enjoy the view with a couple of Bintangs! Also great to stay into the evening as there is lots of live music to enjoy

We went to the beach outside potato head beach club. My 3-year old son loved it and we stayed for an hour and a half!

I walked the whole bay from Kuta (southernmost point) to Petitenget beach (northernmost point). Best place I found for family was just north of Jl Camplung Tanduk (the road with The Royal Beach Hotel). When you get to the beach turn right and about 200 M is a place to avoid the masses, a bit quieter, Sunbeds are around 100,000 Rupiah on the beach (¬£6)

I'm from a country (the Philippines) with incredible beaches, if I may say so myself, so my expectations about Seminyak Beach was a bit high. It was okay, but nothing more and nothing less.

The vendors peddling beach chairs and umbrellas can also get in your nerves if you're unprepared for them. I recommend haggling low, then working up to a compromise.

This is a strange beach - it goes on for miles and miles but it's not like the beaches of Thailand or other comparable locations. The shoreline is very very shallow, so you can walk out about 100m and the water is still only up to your waist but the currents are very strong so you can only really swim between the designated flags and even then the waves will smash into you. The sand is dark and very fine (so pretty sticky). However, the sunset is beautiful and it's a great place to rock up, sit on bean bags with a Bintang at the end of the day.

Disappointed with Seminyak beach. Really surprised how expensive the lounge hire was considering how cheap everything is in Bali. The average cost was 400IRP per day for 2 loungers and a umbrella. This is about ¬£23.
Also the beach area near Ku Da Te we found it to be really smelly and the water very dirty. There are a couple of water outlets which come out into the sea here causing these problems. But if you go towards Kuta it seems to be fine.

Don't know how it used to be before but it's too overcrowded with tourists now. And annoying, fat, richer ones too;

The beach is vast and glorious. You see many activities taking place here and can purchase many things from your towel such as scarves, jewellery, food and drink. Surf lessons are offered and both surf boards and body boards are available for rent at a decent price. You can also hire beds near the hotels. When we went 'swimming' however we struggled with the size and ferocity of the waves. It was great fun trying to body surf the waves and I'd totally go again. A close eye would be needed to be kept on children in and around the water.

Music, drinks and chairs to relax in the evening, Seminyak is the best.! We stayed in Hotel horison so it was convenient to walk down to seminyak beach. Also, double six beach is just beside to this seminyak beach. There are many restaurants oppo to these two beaches. Pretty good time if you looking to just relax and get a peace of mind with friends and family.

We had stayed in Nusa Dua and Jimbaran Bay before and loved this section of Bali at Seminyak near The Legian as the beach is long, sand is soft though not white. You could walk all the way along all the hotels, resorts, restauranrs, bars and surf! Surfing class is 200,000 rupiah, rental is 100,000 and boogey board is 50,000. Wave is great and our teenage kids ride on the wave on their first class! Would definitely stay here again next time!

Despite the crowd - we still love this place. Even though it is starting to feel like an European resort - we hardly see many Asian tourists , which is a pity. Sunsets are really fantastic

Meh! I am no Globetrotter but I have travelled the world fairly well and I do love I do love a beautiful sunset, yet this one will not rock my world for sure.

Been there, done that, didn't buy the t-shirt like the 3000 other people there.

Verdict = Tourist trap.

I am sure there are better places to watch a sunset in Bali and I will look for it next time here.

Loved chilling out eating dinner and having drinks in the bean bags on the beach watching the sunset. Get there early though

Beach 66 at seminyak is the best place in Bali to relax & chill out. With restaurants on the beach & cocktails all day to live music at night it's the place to be to chill out & unwind.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,87,40>===============  
The Indian ocean waters are beautifully warm in Bali and the waves not big enough to torment anyone. The beach itself is not particularly beautiful and cleanliness not its key feature but it is great for long romantic walks and we felt very safe even at night. Walk south east for the eventful surfing areas, north west for the quiet spots.

I am just reviewing Seminyak Beach ( Marriott hotel beach). Its been a long time since we used to holiday in Bali. but over 10 years ago, Bali beaches were polluted (full of rubbish), fortunately, this have changed now, beaches are clean. This in itself, will play a big deal for our next holiday destination.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,87,30>===============  
Beach is fine in terms of views, but its not for swimming, if you are surfer you will probably enjoy it. Anyway if you are looking for place to chill and swim do not go here.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,87,20>===============  
Did not like the beach at all. Was very over crowded and just full of sun beds. There are however beach clubs you can go to or places similar to this. I think it lacked culture.

A nice walk along the beach.. a long stretch of beach with good surf.. a few locals selling products along the way

Loved my surf lesson - so much better and cheaper compared to the US! The beach is clean and very beautiful, cool but not freezing water, and the cafes along the beach are great.

This beach is used for many different things, religious ceremonies, family group outings (on Sunday as it's their day off), and of course for tourists parading their new swimwear! Every few metres is a bar, some have food others have loungers, and a lot of them have public toilets. Some charge a few coins others are free. On our last day we noticed groups of workers on the beach collecting litter and debris from the previous days' high tides. Nice to see.

Once upon a time this beach was fabulous and a place to watch the sunset orange over the ocean. And I'm sure it will be again once the Balinese gov discover the benefits of sewage treatment...

We went to Seminyak Beach twice. Both times at Sunset. Beautiful view! The beach is clean and family friendly. The fresh corn available at the entrance...not to be missed.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,88,30>===============  
The beach in Seminyak is okay. It's not the best but it's not bad. The waves are very strong so you have to be careful when staying there. The sunbeds sometimes get waves underneath them as the tide comes in very fast and far. However the location is very good as there are lots of restaurants and market stalls near.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,88,30>===============  
Corse sand and rough waves don't be fooled by hustlers selling seats a towel is still a great ideal. People selling aray of small gifts for your friends back home. Restaurants near by and drinking allowed whoah

Lovely, kids loved the day. Tide is really strong, so hold onto the children.

Downside, beach chairs can be very expensive, so best to bargain and or take lots of towels. Could not find anywhere to wash feet once off the beach. Also, quite hard to get hold of a licensed taxi (bluebird).

Recommend, but be prepared if with children
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,89,40>===============  
The beaches are small and crowded but clean. good place to drink and eat alongside. Sometimes too many vendors spoil the fun but overall good experience

If you like your swim in the sea a little bit on the rough side this is a great. Kid took surfing lessons, the waves and current were a bit rough; we were immediately warned and pulled back whenever we ventured a bit too deep. The beach is clean and so is the water, don't know why some visitors have expressed otherwise. I loved it.

We parked ourselves at Mumma Rondas chairs over a few days during our stay. She is one of the loveliest most helpful and grateful ladies I've come across. Chairs with umbrella cost 10NZ for 2. She has fresh fruit salad, 3.50, Bintang and other assorted drinks including fresh coconuts. You do get the Hawkers trying to sell to you moreso if you sit in the loungers than on the beach. As the sun is so hot I would recommend grabbing a sun lounger and fending the hawkers off. Waves were too big for body surfing for us but we still had fun. There's a public toilet across the road, very stinky but find me one that isn't in Asia!!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,89,50>===============  
We visited this beach several times on our trip, both during the day and the evening.
The water is clean and the sand is soft. The beach was busy but we always found a sun lounger to rent or a space in a bar. This beach is a must in the evening before 6pm to watch the sunset whilst sat on a colourful beanbag with cocktails in hand. A real experience with music and the hustle and bustle. There are many beach vendors selling various bits and bobs, we just learned to wave them off and not be bothered by it. The water is too choppy to swim but great for paddling or body boards etc. We read reviews before our trip to say the beach was dirty but we found this to not be the case. We ate there several times and found the food to be great, but a little pricey in comparison to off the beach.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,89,30>===============  
Not really a picturesque venue....But the massive waves are good, brilliant for surfing especially it being so close to Canggu. However if your here for the ambience lol yeah just get a bed & drink coconuts lol..... You'll need it. Also a bit crowded so but well, at least you get the beach
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,89,30>===============  
The beach was good to watch the surf as there was lots of massive waves ideal for surfing but there is no swimming along much of the beach and lots lifeguards.
Many many bars along the beach that get very crowded at night.
Beach is not ideal for young kids as sand dirty and the waves are far too big for the kids to be able to swim.

Nice large Beach area, but not very clean. The sunrise/sunset views were the best. We had a short walk from our hotel to the beach. It wasn't immediately obvious how to access the beach, but we did find an entrance pass the police station. There was a lot of activity in this location, there's a place to rent scooters and enjoy street food. There was a lot of people in the area selling local fair. The grilled corn stand with the brown sweet butter, drew a crowd.

Great views and waves, one of the best surfing spots in the world! Its always vibrant with lots of restaurants by the beach, plenty of activities going on, enjoy a game of football or jump on to a karaoke machine and sing away.

Seminyak Beach, jalan Raya Seminyak, 24 hours. Seminyak Beach is a beautiful white sandy beach situated in north of Legian Beach. The white sand stretch 3 km from Tuban Area has made it as a fascination for tourist to visit this place. Seminyak Beach is favored by the great wave that is ideally for surfing adventures hence many surfers visit this beach to conquer the waves and enjoy the surf adventures. This beach is also featured by beautiful panorama to the Indian Ocean, the wide white sand, complete public facilities, the word class hotels, international restaurant and more.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,90,40>===============  
Seminyak beach is a nice large beach to walk along with lots of bars / restaurants to enjoy. It is not an overly clean beach - we come across a lot of dog poo! And the sand isn't golden white. We wouldn't attempt to swim either as the sea is very tidal and wavy.

However, it has beautiful sunset views, is lovely to walk along and is very wide. It's definitely worth a visit but it isn't your relaxing beautiful Caribbean beach.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,90,40>===============  
Walked along the beach every day we were there. The waves crashing in are just amazing, no wonder there are so many surfers there. Sunset was breathtaking.

A lot of people selling things on the beach from jewellery, hats, sunglasses, kites, canvases etc. if you sit on the bean bags on the beach or at many of the bars on the beach you can be pestered constantly. At night the beach is lit up with colour from the umbrella lights and the neon hanging lights. Bands play at the bars and it's certainly worth a visit or two.

Seyminak Beach is beautiful when you first see it. The waves are crazy and it is a long and impressive. However, I was a bit disappointed as it was pretty dirty in places and sewage smell was also quite strong in certain sections. Also I was there in July and there were massive crowds. I would save my time for the beach in a better place on the island than here.

Our daughters were up for trying surfing and according to locals here, it should be Seminyak, so we hired a driver and went to the west coast.
Water was more waves than east coast (Sanur) where we stayed.
We found a place with some goid lical instructors and the girls had fun surfing for a couple of hours.
Price was 150K for approx. 2 hours, so ok.
Also great clean sandy beach and at least this day no plastic and rubbish lykng around.
So overall a great day at Seminyak beach.

We visited Seminyak beach in 2007 and the place was a haven of tranquility with the locals swimming and fishing in the ocean. Fast forward to 2017 and the beach feels like the gold coast of Australia, so busy and not the place it was. That said, I guess it's progress and it's a lovely long beach, but there's nicer beaches in Bali.

Excellent location

Clean, beautifully appointed, spacious room with superb views over the sea.

The friendly and very helpful staff made us welcome at all times.

The breakfast buffet was extensive and if you could order from a menu in addition to the buffet.

Would happily stay again.

The beach itself is not the best out there, we found it to be quite clean but I think that is dependant on the tides. The best thing for us about this beach is that you can walk up and down long stretches, particularly as the sun sets. It is nice seeing people go about their daily lives, kids playing football, making kites, locals running and walking their dogs. It has a relaxed vibe. We didn't visit any bars or clubs, but if you're into that then I'm sure you'll find plenty to amuse you here.

The beach has big waves - good for those who want to try surfing. Sand is not so white but the view is okay. There are umbrellas and benches that you can rent if the sun gets too hot. There are lots of tourists when we visited since it's summer, so it's kinda crowded. You can also run along the coast if your hotel is just nearby.

Crowded, dirty, strong tides, and just could be better.

People bring their dogs and they are playful with anyone.

Dirty! Empty coconuts and garbage, a better effort should be exorcise to keep this place cleaner.

Too much money is request for a chair and the people in charge can be rude, they want their money!

The waves are too harsh for swimmers and yet too small for seasoned surfers. The waves are filled with black sand so it tends to stain your clothes and follow you to the hotel. Nightlife is great with a good choice of live bands
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,92,30>===============  
This is the first time we have been to Bali and chose the hotel on the basis that it was next to a great beach with good surf. What we hadn't experienced before, however, was a level of concern that swimmers would get into difficulty in the waves and rip that meant that swimming in anything other than ankle deep water immediately attracted a loud whistle blow from the lifeguards. Thankfully we had a pool at the hotel and the kids could go in the sea for surfing lessons but we could not enjoy beautiful waves as much as we wanted. All that said, the sunsets on this beach are amazing and the balance of nightlife, restaurants and shops is just right. Maybe if we had known a bit more about the nature of the rip on the coast we would have gone somewhere else which came better recommended for swimming but then we would have to sacrifice the vibe.

Yuck---so many people and no place to sit without someone wanting to charge you. Noisy road next to beach and so much trash. Water not even that warm. Such a disappointment after the lovely beaches elsewhere in Bali. Not sure what the attraction is.

Seminyak beach is stunning. It's not white sands but dark volcanic sands. But the good news is no pebbles so easy to walk on without foot wear and very child friendly . The beach is very clean. Negatives not always swimmable the waves are quite high and strong. It's great for surfing and there are many restaurants including Potato Head & Ku Da Te ...
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,95,50>===============  
Seminyak is much quieter than those further down the coast such as Legian and especially Kuta. There are a number of big hotels bordering the beach but also some nice bars and restaurants. Same facilities available as the busier beaches - chairs, umbrellas, surfing, etc. There also seemed to be less beach sellers up here too.

Great to wander and sit and watch the world go by in a bar before wandering back again.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,95,50>===============  
Seminyak beach like that whole stretch from Kuta Legian to Seminyak is great. Get a lounge for around $5Aus for 2hrs ( negotiate ) and soak up the sun sea and all the carrying on around you. You can get a cold drink from the guy on the beach you just have to put up with the beach hawkers but if you dont want to buy or have a massage, nails done just so No. Like all the beaches its not the whitest sand but its great. Relax and enjoy.

Bali is a lovely country with friendly people. Seminyak is a lively, trendy place that caters well for all ages and tastes. However, beware on the beach especially that can be full of dog excrement that dog walkers leave and do not pick up. We watched many just leave it, or even cover it with sand. Then, some unsuspecting walker stands in it with bare feet. Not good. As a seasoned, worldwide traveller this is the worst place I have seen with regards animal faeces. The pavements in the town can also be full of the same. It's a shame as it it's the only downside of a great place.

Great sunsets from seminyak beach, with alot of cool bars/ restaurants to enjoy a cocktail and take it all in, my favourite being Ku Te Da. As far as beaches go in Bali i think there is better as this is typically where most people flock to, making it the one of the more run down beaches too.

Not a beach I would recommend. There is a terrible smell of phosphate and sewerage, and we decided not to swim in it for 2 reasons, one the dirty water and two the waves were huge and lots of current. The waves were envigorating to watch rolling in to the shore. I guess that is a positive.
A host of restaurants are scattered along the beach. Beach loungers available to hire.
Most resorts had do not swim signs up, due to currents and had security staff looking out for those who ignored the signs. Make sure you choose accommodation that offers a pool.

It is nice beach for first visit when you arrive on Bali, but there is a lot of coral pieces in sand so Its hard to walk on beach without flip flops on. Apart from that its lovely as all Bali. They are serving drinks, beach boys are not too annoying like for example in Kenya.

On the beach, there are couples, families, groups of friends, dogs, you name it.
It really is a place for all.

A very long stretch of beach with blackish sand and turbulent waters with strong waves. Lovely to watch the waves come into the beach and fun to be in the water and have the waves crash over you but do look out for the strong currents.
The sunset is quite spectacular so well worth catching this.
We couldn't find any good public baths or toilets which is an area the tourist promotion board should look into. However there are restaurants and cafes along the beach that you could use but no shower facilities or changing rooms that we could find.

The beach has lovely sand, however it is not good for swimming. It's more of a surfing beach, the waves are very large sometimes. I preferred Legian beach although Seminyak beach seemed to be clearer to see the sunset. (Might have been weather related)

Whether you want to walk along the beach, go surfing, sit and have a drink or eat a meal, you will find what you want on Seminyak beach. The foreshore is lined with little eateries and bars overlooking the ocean. During the day there are sun lounges and umbrellas. At night there are beanbags and coloured lights out on the sand where you can dine or enjoy a quiet drink. Some places have live music that can be heard from the surrounding venues. You will also be visited by a range of locals trying to sell you anything from sarongs to toys or watches. Just say no thanks if you're not interested.

I have been to Bali many times but never to Seminyak. We walked down to the beach down a very busy road and near the entrance to the beach it was extremely busy and you have to watch for scooters and vehicles, it seems the private drivers park along the street and therefore makes it hard to walk along pavements. The beach was very long and there are lots of bars with bean bags and tables to sit and watch the breathtaking show of the sunset. It was a good place to watch the people walking by and others trying to get the best photo. I found the sand to be a grey colour which made your feet look dirty and very difficult to brush off. There are a lot of local people selling their goods which can get annoying. I was not overwhelmed by this beach and on our way back to the road via the path which runs behind the bars a enormous rat ran across our path. I think in future I'll watch the sunset from some place else.

If you are a surfer, you have to go to Bali and visit the beaches - one of them being Seminyak. The waves are good for beginners as well as people who surf regularly.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,100,50>===============  
Great spot to surf in the mornings and a very relaxed atmosphere. Always barter for surfboards and sun loungers. By the time we got the hang of it, we consistently paid IR100k for a lounger and surfboard for the ENTIRE day. In the beginning we paid that for an hour, etc. So just keep walking if they don't agree - you'll get your price. But do it respectfully.

This beach is very good for a quick dip but predominately for surfers. That in itself is good because there is always something to see while your there. There are an abundance of bars on the beach and they all seem good. Street food is available if your game or you can bring your own. The downside is that there a lot of beach vendors who will approach you. Buts thats everywhere in bali. Overall we had a great time there on many occasions.

This beach was clean with beautiful sunset views. Me and my daughter spent almost 3 hours at beach, U can relax near the shore there are paid benches available. Book your chair and watch the sunset. Great place to catch some waves when the surfs up. There are local vendors for coconut water, beer, corn etc. my daughter went for local braids done by local Indonesian personal. It was overall enjoyable place.

Seminyak beach is a public beach & has everything to offer for every age. It has many open air restaurants on beach to drink & dine with LIVE music & enjoy the ambience. Across the road you have plenty more open air restaurants. Water is cleaner than Kuta beach. Best part is you can walk from seminyak beach to kuta beach, it is that long....However, this beach is for surfing only, not recommended for swimming. I personally liked this beach more than Kuta beach.

We spent an amazing couple of days enjoying Kuta Beach, Seminyak. The sand isn't powder white because of the volcanic sand and it could do with a beach clean but the waves totally make up for it. Our young daughters really enjoyed jumping in, over and "surfing" the waves back to shore.

Have been to Bali a few times but never stayed at Seminyak so thought it would be a good idea this time around. Seminyak is certainly more lay back than it's two rivals (Legian and Kuta) but unfortunately, like the rest of Bali, the most obvious thing is the RUBBISH all over this beach. There appears to be minimal respect for what people dispose of and what's washed up on the shore. I did notice a front loader attempting to clear some of the rubbish at high tide AM, which doesn't appear at low tide when the rubbish is more evident. Once again, it's all about the money rather than the paradise that people flock here for, and with more and more tourists hitting this little island, if something isn't done this will only get worse. This will be my last time visiting this island as I find it very distressing to see the abuse of animals, nature and little respect for the Eco system that this island has to offer.

If you are looking for peace and tranquility, this is the place to be . Nice , calm , refreshing and relaxing , seminayak is the refined form of kuta which is noisy and crowded .

Touts throng the beach at Kuta and at Tanjong Benoa, but not at Seminyak. Its a lot more peaceful. The beach is so clean that it is safe to jog barefoot!

The sunsets are also amazing. The beach side establishments: Ku De Ta and Potato Head also lend to the laid back, yet happening atmosphere to the beach.

This beach is way better than the one at Kuta. Definitely worth a visit.

Seminyak is Bali's most fashionable beach, home to among the island's luxurious resorts and host to a number of fine restaurants and boutiques. Fashion stores and top dining spots.
Seminyak's Petitenget Beach offers a more secluded ambiance compared to its sister strands of Kuta and Legian to the south.
Evening scene more nice.

We decided to walk from Seminyak beach to Kuta Beach. Average speed. Took a couple of hours as we had to take refuge under beach umbrellas from the rain. Credit to people cleaning up as hardly any litter on the sand. Water looked clean but not sure with water from the roads flowing straight into the ocean. Not too many dogs running around the morning we went. Maybe the rain put them off?

If there's even such a word. Bali is home to a multitude of scenic sunset views and Seminyak isn't shy of holding quite a few records of stunning photographic opportunities. Take a stroll after breakfast or just before dinner when the sun is about to set and I can guarantee you that your life's perspective would change. Clean sandy white beaches, azure blue skies and the deep vast ocean blue are just a couple of things that would rope beach-goers and water sports enthusiasts.

Went to this particular stretch of the beach and I actually find Seminyak beach much better than Kuta's beach which I had visited years ago. Seminyak beach wasn't as dirty as I imagined from the reviews, I didn't really see rubbish in the sea or dead fishes washed ashore (as seen at Kuta)?!? Waves were huge in the evening so it's definitely not for swimming, but the sunset was beautiful! There were no hawkers trying to sell us stuff too, as compared to Kuta's constant stream of persistent hawkers.

Some said that the beach is filthy, but i think the Seminyak is still can be consider as clean, both that there were not any garbage and trash, and also there were not many locals trying to sell you things unlike in Kuta.

good and wide space, the beach is perfect for waiting sunset, and just sitting around enjoying oneself or letting your kid plays with the sands.

the wave is quite big in the middle, not suitable for swimming, specially for kids, but it will be a perfect spot for surfing.

My wife and I selected and booked a luxury hotel on the beach as we enjoyed a beach holiday and swimming in the sea. We were most disappointed with the filth along the whole of Seminyak beach and in the sea. On enquiry we were told that the waste were wash ashore from another part of Indonesia. If you want a beach holiday in Bali this is not a place to go. Will not return and will not recommend tourist to go

Big waves, kind of crowded and lots of people wanting to sell you stuff. I'm not a surfer so I found it hard to appreciate the beach although I understand that surfers do. Wouldn't recommend it if you're not used to swimming with big waves and it's suitable for children.

Similar to Petitenget beach, just a little busier. Sea is too rough to swim in, but great for surfing. If you've visited other beaches in South East Asia, this isn't worth making a special effort to visit

This beach was nice for drinks at night but as far as the water goes it was a bit rough. The waves were small but the undertow was mighty. Also, if you think you are far enough back you are not. Take a look around and see where the chairs are placed and know that the water will come up to and sometimes past them. At night we saw a couple of rows of beanbag chairs and tables being taken into the ocean. It was funny until you realized that the customers not only lost their drinks but possibly their cell phones too.

The beach shelves away quite steeply here and results in 'dumpy' waves that wouldn't be great for small children and isn't that conducive to swimming.

A nice beach to go for a walk on although there are lots of beach umbrellas and loungers set out during the day, so you are best to go early in the morning when it also a bit cooler.

Great beach to watch the spectacular sunsets especially from cool beach clubs like ku de ta and potato head. These beach clubs are more pricy but they are recommended top end clubs .

went specifically for the surf, and is for experienced surfers only. My son who has surfed all over the world found it quite dangerous. The beach was closed for surfing on a few days and would recommend early mornings as being the best time to go.

My friend and I got a sun-bed for 200k Indonesian Rupees for the whole day - that's 100k each, we tried other beaches around the area and the prices asked were about the same; you can, if you're up to, bargain the prices a little bit though.
The guy, who lent us the sunbeds took great care of our things too - the one time our shoes were washed away by a wave, so he secure them for us, etc.

The beach is amazing to have a sundowner drink, the bars/restaurants will let you then sit on a beanbag at the beach with some fancy small umbrellas - super cute.

Seminyak beach is really nice In my option, not quite the tranquil paradise like beach you think of when visiting Bali but this place has a really good surf beach which is clean and fun. The best part of Seminyak beach is at night, it really does come to life. Everyone gathers to watch the sun set drinking beers on all the bean bags they put out, really great atmosphere and amazing sun set!

Seminyak Beach is lovely in many ways. There aren't too many hawkers bothering you but at the same time there's plenty of shacks to get a drink or some fresh coconut water. Definitely recommended!

My husband and I took our 1 and 2 year old to the beach in morning and we had a spectacular time. I don't think it is one of the prettiest beaches I have been to though we still had fun.

We brought sand toys from one of the market stores which we used to dig and build castles and in the water along the shore we jumped the waves while watching the surfers.

It was early (830-1030am) in the morning that we didn't get hassled by any sales people.

I have been to Seminyak beach in the evening with the kids for dinner and drinks as well. We did get a lot of people coming up us trying to sell us things. My husband had enough whereas I didn't mind it was window browsing for me while I sat and enjoyed my cocktail. They were great as they didn't bother the kids who again played with the beach toys.

When you live in Australia the beaches of Bali don't really compare to what we have at home. Seminyak's great for beach bars to watch the sunset but it's not the crystal clear water haven that can be found on many neighbouring islands.

Visited twice, both times before dusk. Bit cloudy on the horizon so the sunset was not really beautiful although once was pretty good. But the beach itself is great - wide, flattish & genuinely one of the great beaches of my life especially in the late afternoon. Maybe not spotlessly clean but better than those in my Melbourne experience. Romantic & exotic as well as great weather always - quite vibrant too with so many things happening on the beach.

If you're looking for fairytale white sand and see through glass water, not the place..if you are looking for chilled out party vibe,ok swimming, easy surfing it's great..good place to hang out soak up some sun and good vibes...think way toned down, cleaner, Kuta..you can rent a board for 50k, there are low pressure beach peddlers that are accepting to a polite no thank you, you can get 2 beds/umbrella/table for 50k an hour, bean bag bars at sunset are great...check it out

This is a nice beach for sundowners and surfers - not a swimming beach as a result of the surfers although you could have a quick dip at sunset when the surfers stop - nice sand and a great walk - lots to see and do - pictures and there are the beach vendors but they are very nice.............lots of clubs and restaurants along the beach W, Potatohead etc. La Laguna Restaurant and small independents - you will find something you love here............

Seminyak Beach is THE place to go for a " sundowner " . This is Aussie slang for a great place to be to watch the sunset and be a part of the day turning to night . For many this is a significant part of the day . With a great choice of Bars Restos and other attractions you are spoiled by the array of eating drink and just plain hanging out options . Be careful if you have children as all beaches are a risk .

Seminyak beach is very picturesque. Long expanse of white sand, dotted with beach clubs, restaurants and hawkers selling their wares. You can sit in bean bag chairs with a Bintang and watch the sunset. There was one man selling black Pirate Ship kites that looked amazing floating over the ocean. The waves are very strong, I just walked into the water a little way and the pull from the waves nearly had me off my feet. The water is a great temperature.

The views of the beach are stunning day or night. Unfortunately there is rubbish along the beach and some has washed up. Such a shame that people using the beach aren't better disposing of rubbish.

The beach can be crowded in parts but the upside is you can book activities easily or buy a drink. There are bars and hotels along the beach too.

It is a must see spot. Enjoy!

The beach is beautiful and the waves high but I tried swimming and it wasn't pleasant. The sunloungers are about 150k for 2 all day which is a lot. The people selling things are a bit much but you have ro pretend to sleep! They are nice people but persistent and they are friendly. Bali is quiet right now due to a terrorist attack in Jakarta and the people are feeling it so it's difficult to be annoyed. The sea was also brown in places, it looked like cooking oil. There are lots of stray dogs all over Bali including the beach which is heartbreaking.

The beach is less crowded compare to Kuta. The waves are decent for beginner to start learning how to surf. Many vendors for board rentals, and the boards are much better shape compare to those in Kuta. I paid 50k IDR for 1 hour of long board soft top rental. But negotiated for lower rate when I rent more than 1 board or took it longer than 1 hour. Lot's of cafes too on the beach ground so you can relax and enjoy watching sunset afterwards. No public shower place, if I am not mistaken (Kuta has them).

Lately people are complaining about the thrash in Bali beaches. When I ask a local, he said that there is periodical clean-ups of these beaches. So just before this you might encounter a very dirty beach. But I guess most of the time they are allright.

I don't normally like to give bad reviews. But here you have to. Long beach with lot of restaurants and other outlets. But people will pester you to buy their products. At some point you will get irritated. Now coming back to the beach, it is dirty and lot of waste here and there lying around. Not clean at all. Rubbish all through the sand. . This beach is for new comers. Those who hasn‚Äôt experienced what a real good beach or sea side will call it great as I have seen some of the reviewers do. But if you have gone to Mauritius, Seychelles or some islands in Thailand then you will know what clean beaches do look like. Have been to many beaches around the world. But really disappointed with the way they kept the bay. Same with Kutta beach as well. Sunset is the only good thing you can say about this beach. There are lot of hotels on the line of beach side which has pool. Try to get a room there and sit and relax in the pool side as they are much better.

To me this beach is just as busy and has just as much sales people on it as Kuta and Legian. My boys that surf said the wave break was better.

Much nicer beach than on the eastern side of the island at Sanur but water is sometimes very rough with signs out prohibiting swimming.

The sunset is amazing. But yet each can be quite dirty in places.

Tends to be better outside of the private beach clubs.

If you can get a hotel or villas to allow you onto their private part of the beach, this is your best bet if you want to spend a whole day there.

During the wet season, the currents bring lots of rubbish to the beach, so do your research and check your seasons!

Long beach along Seminyak. Unfortunately Bali is so busy, the beach here didn't seem to get looked after. Lots of plastic bags, rubbish and even glass found on the beach. Unfortunate. The touts along the beach were also trying to charge ridiculous money for beach chairs.

I found this beach as average and disappointing. Quite clean, without any shade to hide apart the overpriced umbrellas and deckchair for rent (IDR 250.000 per day).The sea is clean but great waves are good for surfers not for swimming. Also too low tide makes water shallow for swimming, jgood just to sit and let the water pass around you. You are also heavily bothered by hawkers. However the beach is nice for endless strolling around.


But sunset is spectacular many tourist and locals gather here to watch it. If do not want to sit on the beach you can laze in the bar, sipping beer and admire the sunset.

If you come from a pristine country like Australia, very few beaches elsewhere can compete and so it is the case in Bali; but Seminyak Beach was 7 minutes walk to our hotel and allowed us access along the whole stretch of Seminyak and Kerobokan beaches. It is faster to walk along beach front to say Potato Head Beach Club than to use the winding roads in Seminyak. We used it as our quick access to some other places like Petitenget Temple.

=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,113,40>===============  
We did not realized coming into Bali that the beach at Seminyak was really not swimmable and more for surfing, so we were kinda bummed on this, however, it does allow for endless hours of walks along the beach and the water in May was very comfortable and delightful.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,113,50>===============  
Looks like a great surf beach, we walked a small way along it , was a rough day so no swimming allower
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,114,30>===============  
What can I say, there are a lot of great beaches over in Bali, however I didn't see anything special about this beach.

It is still a nice beach to see and swim but there is a lot of other beaches that you can choose from. It smells at times from the water running off from the Seminyak itself.

And be prepared to be bothered by the people selling stuff and coming up to you when you're relaxing.

Overall, it is just a beach with no real special qualities but if you want to go to a beach and am close to this one then you will be able to swim and relax by it if you like.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,114,40>===============  
We made some nice strolls on the beach, visited few beachbars, where you can chill and watch sunset enjoying nice food and drinks. The beach is wide until you reach the sea. Sea is warm with high waves. Good for surfing and kiting.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,114,50>===============  
Hire a boogy board, or just relax on a sun lounge. for a quiet beach enter through Ku-De-Ta security gate.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,114,50>===============  
Many places rent sun bed and umbrellas quite cheaply. The sand itself is generally of good quality and you can use the beach to either relax or seeing sunset. We loved this beach and it holds many fond memories for us
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,114,50>===============  
Clean and nice Long Beach walk to go best in morning and evening time. See the sunset in this ocean will be absolutely beautiful and must to try.

Great staff, lovely food but owner was on site and DID NOT Acnowledge Australian visitors. His agourance will make me stay elsewhere else but here

First time to Seminyak Beach and feel disgusting with all the dirty and black sand beaches. Not good for swimming buy good for surfing. Thought can have a quiet sun tan at there, but everything there have to pay, we cant just lay our towel there, so no choice sit at one of the cafe and order drink..annoying was the beach vendors are everywhere. They keep asking you to buy something or massage. Quite disappointed with Bali. Anyway the sunset was very beautiful though..
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,114,30>===============  
Standing and viewing the endless beach stretching before you is breathtakingly awesome. The sea rolls in with large breakers, which are perfect for the surfers and again, watching them battle against the elements is a sight that never ceases to amaze. However, walk along the beach and there is rubbish strewn about. In some places the beach is discoloured and you can see why from the effluence in the water. I did not venture in it and I certainly was amazed that others let their children anywhere these obviously polluted parts. It was a great disappointment and made me wish that I had chosen anywhere else in Bali other than Seminyak/Kota. They would do well to organise parties of people to clean the beach each day and then it might be a safer and more beautiful attraction.

Seminyak Beach has amazing sunset views, the sand is black and the sea is rough but the views are a wonderful pass for me

I visited Seminyak Beach with a friend following a wedding in Ubud. To put it short, it could be beautiful, but the trash makes it dirty and not a great location. I may be spoiled by the clean white sand of the Gulf of Mexico along with crystal clear water...this had neither. I'll try another beach on the next visit.

To be honest I nearly cried when I went to Seminyak Beach. Very dirty around and you are not able to swim in the ocean as the waves are really high. First visit and my last visit. Definitely wouldn't recommend it.

Enjoying evening walk in beach was a very pleasant things to do after working.
Here you can try to eat meatballs or Roasted corn while enjoying the sunset.
There are also some cafes and restaurants that offer different sensations to enjoy the atmosphere of the night on the beach.

Great for a paddle during the day, and a great place to enjoy a few beers and watch the sun set with the wife.

Weather amazing most of the day and night, never had a breeze most of the day before so lovely and warm but low humidity great time of year to be in Bali. And not many yobbos so Allah good.

Quite Crowded but not as dirty as Kuta or Legian. The sunset is just gorgeous. They have event called SOS - Sunset on Seminyak.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,116,40>===============  
The beach itself isn't really that pretty as it has mostly black volcanic sand and alot of the gutter water from the island runs across the sand into the sea, which doesn't smell to clean. But through the day it's great for surfing and at sunset it comes alive with music. So good if that's what your after.

After being in the phillipines and the islands in thailand i am very very dissapointed in the beach here. Just an ordinary nothing special beach

The bars are rather more upmarket, beach was nice, but had a bunch of signs up for No swimming. I even got a chair and a massage on the beach there

Spent our last night in Seminyak, before returning to London. Ventured to the beach before lunch, not a great experience.

The beach, like Kuta Beach, is crazy and packed with people. Quite hard to relax or even take anything in with the consent - "you want drink?, you buy?, massage?, you buy you buy?"

Avoid if you can
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,116,30>===============  
Big big beach but quite disappointed with quality of the sand & cleanliness. Very busy though for sunset which is stunning Maybe in the future it will improve

clean, and lovely place to go. We had a great time with all friends and spending our time to catch sunset there.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,116,40>===============  
A bit too crowded for me but nice sunset beach scene which a lot people will hang around with lots of club
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,116,40>===============  
Beautiful beach to stroll along, you can take more or less endless walks. There are plenty of places to stop for drinks or food. From what we saw, most of the beach is clean. There are however some patches with garbage and brownish water that doesn't look very healthy to swim in.
We stayed in seminyak for five days in early May, not sure if the waves are always this high, but there were red flags more or less everywhere prohibiting from swimming. So if you fancy swims far out in the ocean or floating around in the water, this is not the right beach to go to
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,116,30>===============  
If surfing is your thing this beach is for you. The waves were huge!
As for the rest of the beach, it is quite sad really. There wasn't a whole lot of rubbish but around the drainage areas it smelled of sewerage.
Heaps of dogs around which was great for a dog lover. Not many strays either.
We walked along early in the morning, around 8 so no hawkers.
It was nice, but I think we are a bit spoilt in Australia with amazing white sandy beaches.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,116,30>===============  
Dirty black sand, lots of hawkers was also hard to find. Has Day beds available to utilise but only as a duo no more than two beds near each other
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,117,40>===============  
Such a lovely beach to relax and watch the sun go down. This beach is no where near as busy as Kuta and the vibe is more relaxed and laid back. Different bats have chairs and bean bags set up on the sand with umbrellas and small tables so you don't need to move. The sellers will come up to you with various wares (from sunglasses to fairy floss) but they're not as aggressive as in some other parts as you are sitting in the designated area of a restaurant. The only drawback is that the bathrooms are not pleasant to use - the public ones cost money and are not clean and many of the restaurant ones are not clean either - bring some tissues and hand sanitiser just in case.

Lovely, relaxed evening watching the sun go down!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,117,40>===============

The beach is great as clean. Lots of activity. Come with lots of street vendors but it is to be expected. A quick no and they leave you alone... nice sunset on the sitting bean bags... overall good place to go!!!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,117,50>===============  
Was our local beach during our stay in Bali and was only 25 minute walk through the busy, colourful and vibrant eat street and Seminyak square.

Visited during the day and during sunset and there was a lot of beach to stroll down when we wanted to. The waves are wonderful to watch as the get bigger and more aggressive and sun loungers are easily available with young coconut and ice cream vendors regularly passing by.

We got loungers for 1 hour at 25K Rupiah which seemed like a good price and added a young coconut to the day visit as well.

The water and the sand is clean and the beach wasn't overcrowded at all. Sunset was set to be epic as you get a clear view of the horizon but alas on the evening we went the clouds decided to crowd around the sun as it set.

I know other more secluded beaches provide more pristine waters and sands but Seminyak beach doesn't charge to access it which is always nice.

Our only regret was not visiting the beach more often but our private villa did spoil us as well.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,117,20>===============  
Not the nicest beach in Bali, but ok. Full of pricey flash beach clubs if that's your thing. Better to venture to the Bukit peninsula for nicer beaches and clearer water! Try balangan beach/ Sundays beach club/ uluwatu / Padang Padang...
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,117,50>===============  
Here is the infamous one and only Seminyak beach. Nice beach bars, cool crowd and lots of activities. The sea is always wavy so if you're not a surfer, you might not like it.

Lovely location to watch the sunset. Great bars with bean bags, pretty umbrellas and great music! Visited Taris Bali for a lovely iced tea post massage.

Seminyak beach is quite beautiful and differs from Kuta in that is is cleaner and less crowded. We walked down to Legian for our usual brunch and drink and enjoyed the peacefulness. There are some great hotels that open up to the beach and generally you can go in to the cafes. If in doubt, don't be put off by the security guard and ask them if you can go in. If you are approached by a hawker, simply say no thanks and keep walking, and they will not pursue you (as a rule).
The beach at night is misty with the waves gently crashing on the beach, and I recommend you find a great restaurant that opens up to the beach for a beautiful evening of fine dining. If it is with someone you love, then all the better.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,117,40>===============  
Walking along the beach each day bought new & interesting delights! There's so much going on, you can't possibly see or experience it all in 1 day, & the nightlife along the beach is just fantastic & right up my alley!!

It's a good beach to visit and enjoy the view. Accessible via bike or car. No parking fee. Clean and not much crowded. We went on Friday.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,118,30>===============  
Not the sort of beach you would head to for a days swimming in the sheltered safe waters.
I would imagine that if you wanted to paddle maybe (although the water didn't look that clean - brown colour) but appeared more to be for surfers with big waves.
I'd imagine the sea is quite strong.
If you want to walk along the beach the sea front is quite wide (compared to other beaches in Bali) so all ok.
Good place to watch the sunset if you feel so inclined. Lots of places to sit, eat and drink also. Some venues also have live music.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,118,20>===============  
Seminyak beach is definitely not white sand which I prefer, but the beach itself is dirty and full of trash. There is really nothing special for me with this beach

The beach in Seminiak is not everywhere recommended for bathing. While visiting and walking along the beach I realized that in some places where the water is really dirty and I am not so sure that is not coming from sewages. Plus the huge waves are the delight of surfers not swimmers. If you visit with a small child make sure it stays far from the water due to waves and fast curents
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,118,40>===============  
Best sunset beach by far when it's low tide. High tide is dramatic but the surf is for experts only.

Nice beach but a little unclean and not white sand. There is a terrific incoming waves at all times and it is not suitable for just normal bathing

Not as crowded as Kuta but offering all the same, food was great night shows even better, live gigs up and down the beach, grab a bean bag sit back and enjoy
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,119,40>===============  
The sand is beautiful and soft and when the tide is out there is vast amounts of sand. Was different than our golden sand on the Gold Coast with black sand mixed in. The sun sets into the ocean and is magical.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,119,20>===============  
Not a lot of sand to relax on, dumping waves. At least you dont get overly hassled to buy stuff. Better beaches around to enjoy, or enjoy a hotel pool.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,119,50>===============  
Most breathtaking, warming, magical sunset I've ever seen ! Walked all the way along the beach, lots of little warungs and places to stop and take on the view. Enjoy !

Full of tourist people who just want to spend money and are superficial. The beach isn't beautiful. Women's who comes every 30 minutes trying to sell jellery or other stuff. If you are looking for tranquility it's definitely not the right place !

=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,120,40>===============  
Soft brown sand, big waves, mostly clear water. Current is too strong for many swimmers, experienced surfers will be happy. Can be crowded in areas near public parks and access points, and will get visibly dirtier in these same areas with trash littering the sand...More

Seminyak beach is which one beach in Bali. Perfect to see sunset and surfing too. And many beach bar surrounding.

We have been to Seminayak beach during our stay in Seminayak,Bali. Beach is clean from perspective of Solid dirt like Polythene etc. Sea water has much higher current than Kuta Beach. Number of people can be seen there doing surf.
Best Thing: Branded eating outlets on beach like potato head, less crowded, good for walk.
Beautiful pic background and scenes for sunset.
Near to Tanha lot temple.
Bad Thing: Sewer water for Seminayak drops in to sea so little messy in between.

Overall worth spending time!!

Went there a few times the beach is very big but the sea is a bit hard to swim. If you like to swim or just chill in the water not the best beach for you. Care with the high prices for the sunbeds and the umbrellas.

Currently staying at Seminyak and the beach is lovely. Yes perhaps the sand is not as perfect as our sydney sand but the view from my hotel room is spectacular and when travelling I am looking for something different from home.
I have walked along the beach before in January and there was a lot of rubbish on the beach. I read this is season dependent and in the dry season you don't see the rubbish.
This appears to be true. The beach is lovely and wide and easy to have a significant walk along to other beaches.
Seminyak itself is a busy place. Seems to get busier with each visit. It's easier than what it use to be to walk along the streets but still would be difficult for someone who struggled with mobility.
A zillion great restaurants here to choose from.
All up a great place to stay

My first visit to bali and had no inclination of sightseeing or touring there. Found great reviews of The Cheapest Travel in Bali. my questions were quickly answered and i booked an full day tour with them. Our driver promptly arrived at our hotel and we started our tour. Dewa our driver was very courteous and answered all our question about the tour and even the history of Bali. His politeness, knowledge were on track and very helpful. He accompanied us on our tour and made sure we were comfortable as we entered the chosen places to visit. Dewa's caring and assistance made our tour a wonderful experience. I will definitely use this company again and hopefully have our driver Dewa again. i will highly recommend this company to all my friend and family visiting Bali. Thank you Anantha and Dewa for your exemplanary

I didn't like Semiyak beach at all. Went there once. In fact Semiyak was not what I was expecting. It's really busy with lots of traffic taxi drivers constantly hooting. I just didn't feel relaxed. It felt like we where in a hot noisy city full of designer shops and to find a nice beach you had to go to a beach club with a minimum spend. We left after a few days even though we had a hotel.
We also had a lot of trouble getting cash out. Make sure when using cash machine you press checking account as it has 3 options and you press the wrong one and you don't get any money. A lot of the machines kept running out of money. Everyone from all over the world had trouble getting cash.
Always get a blue bird taxi as they have to use the meter and they are much cheaper. You can download the app before you come called my bluebird taxi.
I went all over Bali and I found the people very friendly everywhere. And if you learn thank you and a bit of Balinese they love it.
Oh if you like wine ( like me) bring it from duty free as it's expensive everywhere in Bali.
Semiyak is not the place for cheap shopping either. It's all expensive cloths shops and we found prices cheaper in Kuta.

This is for anyone visiting, or thinking of visiting Seminyak this year (2017).
These are only our own opinions based on our recent holiday there.
GETTING THERE: Most people will arrive via Denpasar Airport, and from the arrivals hall you'll enter a very busy area with hordes of people holding name boards, and even more taxi drivers vying for your business. My advice here is to ensure that you've pre-booked a taxi through your hotel. Your (c30 min) journey to your Seminyak hotel will then be easier and probably less expensive. Our pre-booked taxi cost ¬£15.
FIRST IMPRESSIONS: Ok, Denpasar and environs is never going to win any beauty awards, if you're familiar with the Far East then the ramshackle set-up, the huge volume of crazily driven scooters, and the antithesis to Western order won't come as a shock, but if Bali is your first time east of the Mediterranean then be patient and stick with it. Seminyak has been designed for enjoyment whilst Denpasar is a capital city with few reasons to linger.
Seminyak is quite compact and this review only encompasses this area and not Kuta. The vast majority of the accommodation in town is either beach facing, or a short walk from the beach.
HOTELS: Whilst we can only comment specifically on one, the excellent Taum Resort, we saw enough of the others during our stay to build a very favourable opinion on standards, most were 4* and quite a few the vaunted 5* quality, and they looked every inch comparable with the best beach hotels in Europe. We saw a number of very smart beachfront hotels with sun decks, pools and lovingly manicured gardens, where the almost daily stunning sunsets could be enjoyed in blissful surroundings.
NIGHTLIFE : This is where Seminyak scores highly. It's set-up for people who like to enjoy life once the sun goes down - but that said, it's not trying to be an Ibiza. We felt that the beating heart of Seminyak was given over to couples, irrespective of age (we're 40's and 50's), and testimony to this were the range of other couples that we met during our stay; the vast majority being Australian (3 hrs flight from Perth for example ). Lots of 'gap year' youngsters and 'Eat, Pray, Love' wannabe types looking for adventure or love (or both). They'd all gravitated to the right place, heaps of great bars and restaurants and enough high-end nightspots to please every taste, budget and preference, most people will have heard of Potato Head and Ku De Ta etc, they're very good as you'd expect, but look beyond them and the supporting cast will enthrall you and your money will go a long way. Although just examples and exchange rates will fluctuate, you'll find most bars trying to lure you in with 2-1 cocktails or 2-1 Happy Hour deals for around (UK) ¬£1.50 for the beer (Bintang is the excellent local beer) and ¬£3 for the cocktails, compare this to London prices and you'll be in the slightly unusual position of feeling mildly wealthy. Eating out bears similar fruit and we enjoyed some brilliant food in extremely atmospheric restaurants for Wetherspoons type prices! For a couple of personal recommendations try La Laguna, Ginger Moon, Batik, Grocer & Grind, but there are nany more as good. In short then, tons of choice, fantastic service wherever you go, and very kind on your pocket (have you booked yet?).
SAFETY: This one comes in two parts. If you're reading this and you're an adult, or going with other adults, then this will be the safest place you've ever been unless you drink too much, if you get drunk then at some point you're likely to fall foul of the 2-wheeled 24/7 carnage that is the half a billion scooters that compete for space on the narrow Seminyak streets, these things are literally everywhere and at times the lunatic drivers (term used loosely ) will mount the kerb and use the footpath. Many of the scooters appear to be carrying at least 3 generations of the same family and they'll all have aboard items such as ladders, power saws, live animals and the sort of stuff we'd need a Qashqai to transport. We took photos of the aforementioned just because we figured the folks back home wouldn't believe us!
Crossing the road in Bali would be classed as a dangerous sport in the Uk, but help is normally on hand courtesy of the ubiquitous security guards, who guard everything. They all carry illuminated batons and make full use of the whistles that they also carry, if they spot that you're struggling to cross the road then they're out there in a jiffy to see you safely across. Top boys.
The pavements are hilarious in that one minute they're there, and then the next minute they've either ended abruptly at a large chasm, or a set of neck height power lines (not kidding) , or....the pavement just reappears on the opposite side of the street.
So, given the last point, I'd implore any parents with babies, toddlers, or pre-teen children to take a holiday elsewhere, because we saw so many anguished parents frantically trying to either control their kids next to the Nurbergring town roads, or trying to stop enough of the wacky races participants in order to get to the other side, hugely dangerous and quite disturbing to see. Bali is lovely but small children brought up with UK road sense are in peril here.
Like I said earlier, sensible adults will have no issues here.
BEACH : This was a shock to us. When we booked our holiday we of course Googled Bali (Seminyak) beach images, and feasted our eyes on the stunning shots. In reality there are times when the long Seminyak Beach is quite the opposite. In the wet season it rains regularly and when it does the stuff cones down in torrents, add to this the generally observed habit of throwing most litter into the gutter, then you'll quickly realise that all of the litter is quickly washed into surface water culverts that themselves wash into the small rivers that flow through the town. These then run straight into the sea, and the tide deposits the whole lot on the tide line early doors the next morning! ! Take a beach stroll on the morning after one of the regular evening thunderstorms and you'll see what I mean.; absolutely shocking mess and not safe for walking on as you can imagine. The Balinese seem to employ a small army of people (many wearing face masks and PPE) plus tractors to try and make good this mess every day. When this has been done then large swathes of the beach do justice to the brochure images, but just be aware that at times the beach can be quite awful and there has to be some effort made to try and improve the littering situation which I have to say is more down to the locals, than the visitors!
TAXIS: Worthy of its own section, the town is chock full of taxis and this whirring convoy just seems to endlessly circulate around the centre (AKA Seminyak Square) looking for anyone 'walking '. We deduced that when Balinese taxi drivers take their training course their first instruction is the assumption that someone walking is in dire need of a fare-paying lift! From the second you creep beyond the wall of your hotel EVERY taxi driver will hit his horn and slow down, many will stop and wind down their window and wait for you to agree that 'yes....you can't possibly walk 100 metres to the beach / bar / shop, and that you need a lift'. The trick is to either smile and carry on walking, or just ignore them. Both methods work equally well but the good news is that these guys aren't the least bit pushy or aggressive. You get used to the patter and we assume that they get used to just driving around all day.
That said, be advised of the ongoing scams. The ONLY officially licensed taxis are Blue Bird. That doesn't help you with recognition because in Bali EVERY taxi is blue and the same model (Toyota ) as the official ones! Also many of the unlicensed taxis have the name 'Blue XXXX' that look almost identical to the pucker version. The difference being that if you ride in a dodgy taxi then the driver will either say "meter not working", or when you arrive at your destination, he will say "no change". The latter is a patent lie of course, and if you enter a taxi with "broken meter " then get straight out. We of course fell fowl of both on day one, but a very helpful 'official ' Blue Bird driver apprised us of the dark side of Seminyak taxis on day two, citing that unlicensed drivers face fines if caught with dodgy meters or if they're discourteous to customers. In summary we found the whole taxi topic amusing, and I'd also add that almost every driver stopped or slowed down if they saw that we wanted to cross the street.
In terms of fares. From our hotel to either the beach or Seminyak Square, both a 30 min walk, we'd pay the minimum evening fare of IDR 30.OOO. Which worked out at ¬£2 at the March exchange rate of IDR 16000 to ¬£1.
MONEY: I've alluded to the generally very agreeable cost of eating and drinking out, taxis I've also said are cheap, and with a total absence of other means of public transport you might want to engage your hotel in finding a locally recommended driver. We hired a friendly driver who took us all around the island for ¬£30 per day, try doing that in the UK and you'll be adding another '0', fantastic value and all of the drivers speak good English (as do almost all Balinese ).
There are numerous ATM's dotted around Seminyak and my wife and I used different ATM's with our respective banks and the exchange rates worked out at broadly the same as the exchange rates that we'd been given prior to setting off from the UK. If you're a single female traveller and are conscious of security with your cards / money then there are a couple of cash machines inside the new shopping mall in Seminyak Square, the latter housing some good shops, but tons of better ones that aren't generic 'high street' around the town that are well worth a look.
THE PEOPLE : If you've been to Thailand then you'll be sitting there thinking that 'nobody is friendlier than the Thai's', I know you're thinking that because we thought so, too. But come here and you'll be truly in the presence of the nicest people on God's green Earth. We were humbled by their humility, their values, their sheer desire to make a difference to your day. The service we received in every single venue, bar, hotel, or even total strangers in the street was so genuine, so wonderful, that to not come back to Bali would be a crime. Come and see for yourself, if you've been promising yourself / husband / wife / partner to take a trip to Bali then go to your bank tomorrow, or beg a wealthy relative for funds, sell that useless artefact or trade-in the boat you never used, and drag your weary body to this temple of soul salvation, I promise you that you will enjoy every moment and you'll return to our embittered crime -ridden soulless country a better person.
SEMINYAK: Yes it's a fabulous destination. It's not without its faults and I'd advocate it's not fit for young children or the infirm, but if your mojo has lost its sparkle then this is the place to lift your spirits. Great hotels, great nightlife, and incredible people.
WEATHER: There are two main seasons in Bali. Hot and wet and hot and dry. We came end of March which is towards the end of the wet season. We had rain almost every day but in the main the rain and thunderstorms came late afternoon or during the night. When it rains it comes down in torrents but the temperature doesn't drop, meaning it gets very humid. When the sun comes out it's blistering hot and most days the mercury will climb up to 32c (90f in old money ) and often beyond. The actual temperature feels hotter so the 'real feel' in the daytime is more like 40c (104f). Bear that in mind if you're fair skinned! At night the thermometer rarely dips below 25c (77f) so you'll not need to bring outer layers here save for a rain mac. What disappointed me was the appalling lack of weather forecast detail available online in the lead up to our holiday. The BBC didn't feature a single location on Bali, others just gave a generic 'cut and paste ' tropics forecast, and the go-to Wunderground (Weather Underground ) gave pessimistic forecasts which simply stated "cloud, frequent thunderstorms " for most of the days we were there, and whilst 'yes' we did get some cloud and some storms, the latter's forecasts made no mention of the 5-6 hours of blazing sunshine that we got each day. Only one day out of 12 was 'bang on' their prediction. So I'm saying don't take too much notice of the forecasts before you come out here, they're not accurate enough! Have a great time.

Seminyak is just full of high end shops and bars and very expensive beach clubs and hotels.
The beach is very average the water doesn't not clean, you only have to look in the little creeks to feed onto the beach to see the quality of the water , most people just use the swimming pools

The one very annoying thing is the people that drive around in early hours of the morning on loud motorbikes disturbing everybody that's trying to sleep.

Seminyak beach is awesome, it has miles and miles of lovely day beach, great swells fit beginners and advanced surfers alike, a great line of nice beach clubs but unfortunately no trees whatsoever so throw you some shade.

Took a walk to see Seminyak beach, as apparently its a place to experience. From what I saw the beach was dirty, with the evidence of the previous nights' beach parties. Why can't people take their rubbish away after they had their fun. Beach hawkers were an annoying problem as well. I appreciate these people need to make a living, but would not accept my saying no to them. I'm am sure they were not Balinese. My only high light of this visit was to see a coconut being washed up on to the shoreline. If you want to experience a beach that is not cared for, then go to Seminyak Beach.

I will keep this short. Most of the beaches in this region of Bali are in a complete mess. Filthy, grimy and in need of some major attention. The issue remains the ammount of businesses, hawkers, stray dogs and litter in the ocean. This on top of climate just repels you from the potential beauty that could have once been seen here in the late 70s / early 80s.

The beach is nice but it is polluted. It is not the best place to swim. The waves are very strong. There are some parts where sea pulls you into the ocean. Please be careful and don't go far from beach. When you try to rest in the beach, many sellers try to sell things and never let you alone.

This beach is really nice to look at. Unfortunately the tide works the wrong way here as the waves become stronger as the day passes. Get a beachclub with a pool and enjoy. But sitting on this beach is not an alternative.... there are better places to sit in the sand. After 16:00 you have the best sun set in the world.... so.... take it for what it is, not how it sounds.

Kuta beach is cleaner, by that I mean the sand is whiter and the water is clear. Or try Padang Padang, although small stretch of sand which gets really crowded.

Visit the beach just before sunset which provides great photo opportunities.
Do not bother going there for sunbathing, you will likely have to pay for your deck chair rental and also approach by the local vendors selling their products.
Just visit the beach for a good photo shoot will do.
You can enter the beach via the side entrance near Kudeta.

Seminyak beach is quite long. It can get quite rough and it's not the most beautiful beach in Bali however it has some fantastic hotels and eateries and it's a great walk! If you need a driver in Bali to take you there, I can recommend Putu at fair dinkum transport and tours. He's on tripadvisor too and took us all around seminyak
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,124,40>===============  
Great beachfront. Beach and water very clean. Sun beds from local vendors are ridiculously expensive and if you need one better go to one of the beach clubs where you get top service and a pool as well.
The surf is amazing but equally dangerous. Do listen to the Lifeguards they know better than you do where it's safe to swim. In some places the current is scarily strong and can just pull you out to sea.

I'm sure if you can see past the rubbish & smell in this beach it would be nice but that's a big if!!!

Good location to busk in the beach atmosphere and watch the sunset.

One of my favourite things about Bali is the service that you can get on the beach. I am not a beach lover usually get you can sit on the beach and order meals and drinks and not have to sit on the sand and it's awesome. You've gotta be firm with locals that are selling stuff on the beach if you're not interested in buying because if you look interested they will show you literally everything you have to offer and it can be hard to get across that you aren't interested once you have started looking which can be awkward.

The sand is clean and soft, the water isn't full of rubbish but you do get the occasional piece. The waves can get pretty rough, I'm a pretty confident swimmer but some of the waves got me pretty good! Overall it's a nice place to spend your time relaxing.

It is a walking distance from the villa I stayed. Clean, soft sands, long coast that you can enjoy walking along with sunshine. The waves is unpredictable. In one day it was great tides and 2 days later it got a red flag up. Luckily I was guided by a local security, he strongly advised me that never go to the water when red flag up. Though I saw a number of tourists and surfers ignore the flag's warning.

Hope you luck to have a good and save wave to enjoy ;)

And you get all sorts of life on Seminyak Beach. It all depends on what you want from a beach as to whether or not it is a good place to go.
The problem here is that for every good point, there is an opposite and vice versa. Firstly this is a huge beach. At low tide very wide and it is accessed by a few gaps in the rows of restaurants, cafes and bars which line the coast usually abutting the access roads . You will pay to park, even a motorbike nearby but then it will be relatively safe. The alternative is that you will get free parking in an isolated area and have you bike pinched or complain that there are no facilities.
This is an excellent beach for running especially by the water and if you go fast enough you wont be bothered by hawkers. However if you stay still for five minutes they will be all over you. Especially if you show any interest in the sunglasses, watch or Ken Holm wok that they are selling. This is truly an international problem now but they have to earn a living and they generally move on if politely addressed. The problem is that there are so many of them there is always another one to follow.
Alternatively, you may just want your hair braiding, sir, or your nails varnishing whilst sitting on a beach. To be honest, you can get pretty much anything you want on Seminyak Beach except probably any peace.
The water is warm but a lot of sand suspension as it is shallow. It can also be windy and because of its undisturbed length,windy and disorientating. Look out for the flags for safe swimming.
A truly high point is to watch the sunset especially with a cold beer at one of the bars or walking along the sand with your partner. If my memory serves me correctly though. If you have the right partner it doesn't matter where you are.
Whilst you are there you may as well go to see it.

The beach is beautiful and very powerfyl. If you're a surfer then you are in the right country. The waves are big and strong.

I suppose we were naive in assuming all beaches on Bali would be like a scene from South Pacific.
Seminyak beach has rather dark sand, suffers from some rubbish and a constant tide, not of sea but of touts trying to sell stuff doggedly but unenthusiastically.
Umbrellas and sunbeds cost about ¬£7 each but are more comfortable than trying to lay on a towel in a high wind.
The sea has a lot of suspended sand as the shoreline is very shallow.
Its always good to be by the sea, however, even when its impossible to find peace.
One of the tourists on the sunbed next to me (which the attendant had already sold to three others before her) was having a massage from two locals plus another one trying to sell her a hat at the same time!
If you are in Seminyak and like a beach there isn't much choice but you might be a little disapointed
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,126,40>===============  
You can rent a sun lounge and spend day lying by the beach. Many vendors try to sell you their wares but they don't hassle you if you tell them to leave. Many great venues line the shores so you can easily get a drink in the hot sun. Don't forget to always swim between the flags. Sometimes the waves can be dumpers. Overall a nice experience which would be recommended
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,126,40>===============  
It's an amazing beach to go for a run/ walk. We tried little workouts here too. I practiced yoga independently.
Watching the sunset as we walked was bliss.
Very popular for surfers because of the huge waves!
There's options to hire sun beds/ bean bags to watch the sunset.
Loads of bars and places to eat along the beachside.

Negative factors are;
1. There's a lot of washed up rubbish on the sand so watch where you step! Especially broken glass pieces on some parts.
2. You have to pay to park and visit the beach. I only put this as a negative factor as it was free in Phuket Thailand! (I know I shouldn't compare but costs can build up if you're visiting daily!)
3. For me, crabs! That's because they freak me out!
4. People trying to sell you stuff - a generic issue worldwide whilst travelling!

Visited 13 April 2017 for surf lesson. Firstly the beach. Grey Black sand with trash and overflowing bins. Tons of beach traders selling fake goods and hair braiding. Did not see a toilet anywhere.

Sad to see stray dogs on the beach as well many of which are pregnant or have recently given birth.

The water looked nice from afar but once in, was filthy and full if trash and used shopping bags and plastic.

A real pity as there is huge potential.

There must be better options than this.

Unfortunately, I agree with all the negative reviews. We were staying at a very good hotel which was sea front and they cleaned the front of the hotel's part of the beach every day so was not responsible for the rest. The few times we walked we did see a dead dog and dog walkers would let their dogs foul and not pick up after them, so pretty disgusting. The GM of the hotel said that the Government are responsible and as they really don't care a fig as you can see from the rubbish on the beach as well as the streets, that the Government is not exactly "Green".

=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,129,30>===============  
I was expected to see a beautiful beach in Seminyak but was a big disappointed to see a lot of garbage on the beach like plastic bags,plastic wrapped and cans. The waves are very high, not able to swim either. Black sand not a problem if the beach is clean. I would say Nusa Dua beach more beautiful, cleanest and quiet than Seminyak beach.

Perhaps living in Australia with its pristine beaches has spoiled us, but I wouldn't even walk on those carbage strewn places you don't know what's buried , there's no excuse for the dirt there, it is only slightly better than Kuta beach.
Bali needs to sort its beaches out to bring them up to a family friendly status.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,129,30>===============  
High waves. Not suitable for swimming but good for surfing.
Water was not clean. We saw things like plastic bags and candy rapers floating in the water.
Lots of people walking around trying to sell you bracelets, glasses, bows, paintings ... etc.
Lots of restaurants and shops around. If you are looking for a busy beach this is for you. If you want peace and crystal clear waters then this is not the best option.

On a recent visit to this Beach I was astonished at how dirty the beach was. I'm mean this is Bali. I understand that the tide brings in trash everyday, but this wasn't overnight garbage. I travel the world and even in the poorest countries I have never seen anything like this before. If all the restaurants would just take care of their portion then the beach would be more attractive for all...

This beach is raved about and I don't know why! It was so dirty on the beach and there was so much rubbish in the water. Most of the restaurants on the beach were quite run down. Lots of people offering you to buy different accessories/paintings/toys.
This beach definitely needs a clean up!
Will not revisit and would not recommend to others.

Our hotel was a few mins walk from Seminyak beach.... It's wide and waves are huge .... You get a variety of bars and restaurants to choose from.... It's nicer and calmer than Kuta Beach ....
In the evenings there were loads of lanterns lights lit up and big bonfire in front of some restaurants.... Lovely atmosphere...Nice stroll and amazing sunset as it's anywhere else in Bali ....You watch people riding horses or walking , surfing .... We didn't dare to go in to the sea as it looked very scary and waves were big .... But beautiful all the same .... If you keep walking then you reach the much busier Kuta beach ... More going on there ....
The reason for a 4 star rating is the sewerage smell and the rubbish .... Probably coming from the hotels we don't know ...
Bali and its beaches are definitely worth a visit...

I'm not sure where some of these other reviewers went but in early April 2017 there was simply not much beach left. Waves crashed right up to the restaurants and it was virtually impossible to walk along the beach! There was a larger amount of dirty grey sand near the temple which was full of rubbish and dogs.
The lesson I repeatedly learn is that if I want white pristine beaches I should just stay at home ( Australia )
Make sure you book a place with a pool

After traveling all over Bali and Lombok and seeing some really beautiful beaches, this one wasn't really that impressive. I was happy to see the water and get my feet in the sand but it wasn't pristine or calming. If you're looking for a really nice beach, try heading away from the city a little.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,130,10>===============  
Before we went to Bali i done research on the local beaches and a large percentage of the reviews were not great so we were not surprised when we arrived to see it full of rubbish and not really inviting, it's worth a visit to say you've seen it as it's only a 15 minute walk from the centre of Seminyak or 5 minutes in a taxi 30,000 one way...

What I would recommend is to hire a cab to take you to some beaches as there's no local transport if you want to spend a day hanging out at the beach...

I went down to Seminyak Beach for the first time expecting a beach of paradise. What I saw instead was a beach full of trash, stray dogs running around, some brown water in the beach and some red flags that's telling you not to go into the water.

Trash. That's what I felt as I was walking around in the water and on the beach. There are lot of TRASH. I couldn't stand in the water for a minute without some kind of trash touching my feet. Wrappers, Cloths, or whatever. Trash. Now I come from Los Angeles where there are a lot of people that go in the water and has commercial businesses all around. Even LA beaches felt it was cleaner and more sanitary than here. I couldn't believe all the amount of trash floating in the water and debris on the beach. I thought this was supposed to be a paradise, instead it felt like where all the trash ended up. Granted some of them could be from Bali and some of them could be from elsewhere just washing up here. Regardless, it felt dirty just standing in the water with the damn trash touching my feet every 10 seconds or so!

I saw some brown water and thought it was weird that the water was so brown. Not all parts but some parts. I asked around why the water was brown and no one knew. Also there were red flags all around and when I asked around, people were saying because the wind was strong and that you could get sucked out to the ocean due to fast & strong current. Also there are apparently whirlpools that will suck you in. That's a scary thought.

I've also seen some stray dogs running around. One time I saw a pack of 5 dogs all playing with each other on the beach. Sure that sounds cute except when you come to realize that some of these dogs could have rabies, probably had no owners, and that they were playing in the beach where people were. I'm sure the dogs don't think about where to pee and poop. I'm from USA where there are regulations against dogs on the beach due to them crapping and peeing which contaminates the water. In Seminyak I've seen a lot of stray dogs around which didn't help the feeling I got about the hygiene and cleanliness of the water.

The water was very warm. That was one plus about the beach. With the clouds far away and the sandy beach all around, this was a plus. There weren't that many pluses given I've also been to beaches in Thailand which were freakin Awesome.

I have travelled for many years and can honestly say l have never seen so much rubbish on a beach. even when you enter the water you are walking in floating plastic and any other form of garbage. The locals are only interested in selling you over priced drinks, or renting you a board for 4 times the price you would pay 5 mins walk away to a side street shop. They are not interested in your comfort if you don't want to lie on the dirty beaches of kuta ,legion or Seminyak you can rent an over priced sun bed.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,131,40>===============  
This could be the most fantastic place. The view is absolutely stunning, not only at sunset but also during the day. Sadly all the garbage and rubbish from the ocean is just lying there in the sand - spoiling the beach.

After having travelled across South east Asia our expectations for Bali beaches were high. Sorry to say we were disappointed except for Seminyak Beach. It was the only one that is being actively kept clean. Only thing is the locals will try to sting you for the sun loungers. We paid 100,000 (¬£6.00 approximately) for 2 beds for 4 hours. I think we overpaid. He originally wanted 200,000.

Perhaps ignorance and lack of research on our part, but the beach itself is dirty, covered with dog's mess and has extremely strong currents. So if you're looking for a romantic stroll and dip in the Ocean, prepare to be disappointed!

Bali is a place known for surfing and so the tides are harsh for swimmers... so swimmers be careful... for the people and families who want to enjoy the holiday on the beach please take your rubbish with you as you can see many people like you left their rubbish there...

Very sad to see so much plastic and garbage on the beach and in the water. Not pleasant to have plastic wrap around your legs when you go swimming. Locals claim it comes from the sea but it's being washed out from the streets every time it rains.
Bali is choking under the weight of its own success. A pity to see it now compared to when I was there in 1974. Very sad!!

The beach was not crowded and the water was lovely and warm. But the waves meant it was not easy to swim. And the water had a greenish-brown tinge. I wondered where the sewerage is discharged from all the local hotels... There are places along the shore to buy drinks, food and to rent sun beds.

Long and wide stretch of sand, perfect for surfers, the waves can be very big at times.
You can rent loungers and parasol at convenient prices 100.000 for the whole day. These also sell fresh coconut ans various other drinks.
There are people selling souvenirs and other things on the beach and offering massages, but very polite and not pestering like in other parts of the World.
The strength of the waves get weaker during the low tide and give chance to swim. By the way if you like tranquil waters for swimmers go somewhere else like Kuta or Jimbaran.
The sunset is very beautiful.

Perfect for a morning or evening walk, Not much of a swimming beach since the waves are very high ans strong so mostly for surfers. It looked fgairly clean but seeing two dogs defecating in the beach was not something I wanted to see.

Beach itself is relatively clean, with a nice view. On super hot days there was an oder - I suspect from the rubbish behind the restaurants along the beach front.

We would rock up at this beach at the end of a long hot day, and just grab a bean bag in one of the many beach bars and watch the sunset.

We were here in March 2017 and the beach was quite clean. We were lucky to be staying at Alila with an Ocean view room so it was great waking up to see locals and tourist having morning walks and having fun. From Alila, we walked along the beach front to Kuta which didn't take long (prob shorter than a taxi ride!) and we also walked in the opposite direction towards Canggu. On our walks we discovered a few local bars (no hype type...) on beach front, so take some Rp with you for a quick stop and support the locals.

Coming from South Africa with our beautiful white sand beaches it has been quite a shock to see so much litter in the ocean. It makes me feel really sad. We are lucky enough to be doing a home exchange and staying at the 5 star Anantura Hotel right on the beach so we just swim in the pool here. It's a great wave for beginners to learn to surf though and my boyfriend had such fun while I taught him on a long board we rented for R50 an hour right in front of our hotel on the beach.

A visit to Seminyak beach is not relaxing. There is rubbish everywhere, dogs running about and doing the toilet in the ocean. You are harassed constantly from not only the deck chair men but also kids trying to sell bracelets, and other people selling watches and sunglasses. You get touched often by women trying to offer manicures and pedicures and massages!!

To top it all off, we watched a women remove her baby's dirty nappy, wash the kid in the sea and then bury the nappy in the sand, 50m in front of us!!!!

This is one of the most disgustingly dirty beaches I have ever seen and I have travelled. The amount of rubbish washed up on the beach and not cleared away is a disgrace and an example of the crisis our oceans are suffering. Why anyone would want to come and sit on it and look out at the rubbish is beyond me and why any Aussie would come from the beautiful beaches in Australia to surf here is crazy.

I went for an early morning run and had to wash my trainers after because I ran through the streams that led into the sea, the smell was so bad, god knows what is in that water and now in the sea.

Whenever we go out for a meal we try to make it back to our hotel via the beach.

As others have mentioned, there is a fair bit of rubbish that washes up which is a shame, so you need to be careful of where you tread at times.

Seminyak Beach has vast expanses of sand and is very flat so a great beach for walking.
We sat outside Ku De Ta so we could hear the music and relax while the sun went down.

We found this beach to be one of the nicest during our time in Bali.
Its not as hectic as the others but yet still boasting lots of local character, the bars are rather more upmarket but yet you can still find the odd local hideaway thats well worth the find so its a lovely blend of local to luxurious.
The good thing we loved was that your not as bothered by all the beach sellers as you are on other beaches and also the sellers here are a lot more chilled.

We have been to most of the beaches around here and this is our favourite. It is probably the cleanest and has lots to do to keep you occupied through the day.

Many places rent sun bed and umbrellas quite cheaply and some restaurants even allow you to use their bean bags for free as long as you give them your custom. There are lots of bars and restaurants in the area and also lots of beach traders.

The sand itself is generally of good quality and you can use the beach to either relax or undertake more strenuous activities. There is lots of surfing and we used to do long beach walks.

Went for a wander down to the beach last night and got the shock of my life. There where hundreds of beanbags and people sitting watching the sun set it was amazing. Restaurants all the way along with very friendly staff and great service. Bands played the whole time we were there. Definitely a must to do at night while on Seminyak

What fabulous sunsets! And what blue water during the day! Sadly, parts of the beach are littered with rubbish. But the other parts are very clean. The beach has black sand.

At the time we went during the day, a swim was out of the question due to the red warning flags, as the sea was rough, but am sure it is a pleasant enough sea to swim in.

Seminyak beach is beautiful, stretching for kilometers. Great for walking, surfing (body, bogey board and just surfboard), and taking amazing photographs of Bali Beach Life and, of course, beautiful sunsets.

It is also lined with some amazing places to eat and sleep (see my other reviews for Seminyak) which are perfect for a drink, a meal or just enjoying the almost nightly beautiful sunsets.

This would be a five star beach except for two, or three caveats.

One is that alot of people have dogs in Bali and bring them on the beach. Which means if you like to walk barefoot on the beach, like I do, then you need to pay extra attention that you don't step into a fresh dog droppings.

Two is that at various points along the beach there are effluents from various parts of town. This is raw sewage. I either walk out in the surf to cross them or just turn around and walk the other way. Needless to say, you don't want to be swimming directly offshore, or down current unless you've had all your shots!;)

Thirdly is a new hazard which I only noticed on this last trip, which is broken shards of glass from beer bottles. The ones I spotted at low tide were in the shallow water and constantly being covered and uncovered by the trailing surf. I made a mental note to myself to pack my white water sandals next time I come.

It's really a shame that such a beautiful natural spot as Seminyak is being polluted in this way. But while the above hazards do detract from the water and beach activities they do not affect the absolutely amazing sunsets.

My dad and I strolled down to the beach right around sunset and caught a magnificent view. The beach is crowded with lots of activity but still beautiful. We enjoyed snapping pictures, walking around and then grabbing a drink and listening to live music as we watched it set. It might not be the best beach for swimming but the nightlife looked great and it was relatively clean (compared to other areas). Definitely not secluded - tons of tourists.

I would loved to have swum at this beach but when I saw what washed up, I couldn't. If what you can see is bad, what about what you can't see? It's still bussing with people and activity however and has a great atmosphere but swimmers were noticeably absent. They do keep sweeping it up but they really need to address the source of the problem for the sake of tourism as well as nature.

The whole beachis a good visit if you are staying in that area. Nothing worth to be specially done from far off distances.

It has few cafes on the beach which have Lazy Boys outside and you can sit and relay and enjoy few drinks while watching the sunset. They even have live bands playing in front of many Cafe's which are pretty decent for a lazy and relaxed evening.

We were disappointed with how dirty it was but found really good restaurants along the beach. Since seminyak is pretty expensive going to a eating on the beach is a good option and you get a great view. Coconuts are 20k and we found great food for 30k. If you like vegan food a place called spicy coconut is worth a visit, just a 5 minute walk off the beach (north part of the beach, near canggu).

Went for a walk along the beach at Seminyak for about 45 minutes and we were saddened to see the amount of rubbish washed up on the shoreline. Considering the beaches on Bali are the main attraction, I believe that a lot more should be done to clean them up and keep them clean. There were literally thousands of plastic bags, drinking straws, cigarette lighters and innumerable other items that just should not belong on a beach.
One can only be saddened to think of what this rubbish, particularly the plastic bags, is doing to the sea life.
Please Bali - Clean up your act!

Wide expanse of endless beach, shared by many hotels dotting the whole strip of beach. The waves are excellent for surfers but perhaps it was this time of the year, that the sea seems to churn up the muddy sandbed and cause the pristine blue water to turn brownish as the waves washes ashore, exposing the filth and plastics along the beach. It is otherwise lovely, and a great place for enjoying the sun and the natural sea breeze. When the sun sets, the afterglow of the setting sun is reflected off the freshly rolled back beach, the contrast and shilouette views makes for perfect sunset photography and sights.

Never saw the beach from Kuta all the way to Seminyak beach and beyond in such a sad state. I loved to walk there for hours but what we saw there yesterday was a disaster:
- plastic garbage strewn over the beach everywhere, not 10 meters without stepping on some garbage
- those village canals bringing raw sewage to the beach offloading their smelly load into the waters.
- brown foam and waves every few hundred meters when another canals lands on the beach
- a permanent sewage smell in the air although it was a windy day
- beach erosion is a big problem; the beach hotels are fortifying their beach line with cement. The stairs from their gardens to the beach has become one meter longer (Legian Hotel) since I have seen it 3 years ago.
We were disgusted and did not go into the waters there.
Our little son got a skin rash on legs and back from that sewage water.
The government needs to act:
- clean the canals
- introduce effective waste management
- stop corruption

The hotels and tourist industry should step up to the government and demand environmental improvement!!!

Good luck

We arrived into Seminyak late on a Thursday and couldn't wait to see the beach on Wednesday morning. Given the time zone change we were up early so wondered down to the beach for a walk. We go there within 5 minutes but what we found was disappointing. It was low tide and all manner of garbage was washed up and the ocean was brown. There were mane workers sweeping/raking up the mess given the many hotels that line the beach. Over the next week things didn't really improve although it was beautiful to listen to the waves at night. Seminyak is a wonderful place but the beach isn't the highlight. We didn't get to see any outstanding sunsets given cloud cover but what we did see was impressive and we had a wonderful anniversary at La lucciola. Also beware of time share workers posing as tourist officers asking your opinion, they get your hotel, your name and length of stay and then bombard you with phone calls. Not pleasant but our villa did a wonderful job at filtering these.

Seminyak beach must be one of the worst beaches we've been on. It's filthy with rubbish everywhere.

Also, as you'd expect, it has heaps of locals trying to sell you things and although we understand they are trying to make a living, saying "no, thank you" every couple of minutes gets somehow tiring after a while...the dark volcanic sand doesn't help the situation and makes the beach look even dirtier.

Seminyak is an upbeat part of Bali with a little something for everyone. Whether you're looking for relaxation and spirituality, or just a really fun bar run, Seminyak has something for you. Love the locals, some of the nicest people I've met.

Seminyak beach offered great wave for surfing, splendid sunset view, easy access to restaurants and shops in Seminyak, and a chain of restaurants and bars along the beach. One problem is, there is a canal (looks like a sewage canal)near Jl Camplung Tanduk cutting through the beach, with piles of waste around the area. This makes the walk from Pura Petitenget to Double six beach (same for the reverse direction) a little bit unpleasant.

To the Balanese government.

I understand that the natural tides dump rubbish on the beaches, but there is no visible effort to clear it up! If every hawker was equipped with a litterpicker and a bin bag as part of the deal you'd sort the problem to a more reasonable degree. Billions of tourist dollars over the years should result in something more than an appologising and apologetic sign!
Having travelled half way around the world to such a legendary and beautiful place the sea and the beaches are a HUGE disappointment and do you no credit Bali!

My family and I recently visited Bali and stayed in Seminyak for a few days. We visited the beach as we had been at Potato Head. The beach was filthy and the sea polluted. It resembled Rhyl beach but worse (for those of you who have visited the UK) After speaking to our local driver, this was due to the time of year and the change in current which washes up the rubbish in this direction. Not what you would imagine for the Indian ocean. Better beaches to visit were Pandawa beach(the best beach by far) Padang Padang and Kuta beach.

I'm not sure if we went to the right part but we walked to the beach and it's honestly the dirtiest beach I've ever seen. It's so grim. We have a pool and the town is fab so that will do is but it's such a shame.

A great place for sunset watching. Many locals go there. Very dirty beach & not fit for swimming. There's also a very smelly polluted inlet to cross. As a beach it is terrible , sunsets yes

I guess being from Australia I'm blessed with lovely beaches so I'm a bit biased. That being said, I've been to plenty of other beaches around the world that have been nice. Just expect rubbish everywhere and not much going on (understandably). This is the exact reason why it's important to book a nice hotel with a pool.

the beach at Seminyak was dirty and disgusting the wind had blown up and it was full of debri, dirty nappy, cane/bamboo washed up on beach old polystyrene coffee cups etc we never swan in beach at all and council or govenrmetn had done very little to clean it up we swam at the pools in Montigo which were clean and refreshing. not the beach at all.

It's always dificult to rate a beach - as it can change daily due to currents and weather conditions etc..
But at the moment - well actually we were there during christmas - the beach is so ugly as there is plastic trash everywhere!! Even if you try to walk into the ocean the plastic swims around your legs and there is at least 6 meters wide plastic trash "raod" at the beach.
The only good thing is that like this everybody sees what we humans do to our planet and to our oceans!!

Given, we do travel a lot. But this is, by far, the ugliest beach I ever saw.

Yellow sand (not white as some say, or you have to be totally wasted), dirty (plastic) everywhere, beach 'bars' not taken care of, all playing their own music at the same time, etc.

By far the worst beach experience ever.

It definitely is a shame to see a beach absolutely littered with rubbish. I did hear that this is what happens every year around New Years. I suppose I'm a bit prim and proper considering Australian beaches are absolutely pristine! I think it just threw me back a little and made me appreciate where I live. Sunsets are amazing here however can't seem to take eyes away from the dirt coloured sand and rubbish that is scattered everywhere :(

Seminack Bali. Can be busy but if you go outside of school holidays it's not to bad.
Check that you have good accomodation we prefere to stay in a private villa as it's nice to have the privacy with your own pool and so on. The restaurants have improve immensely lots of wonderful Australian chefs are now running them and offering fabulous fresh heathy food , you can even get a great cup of coffee.

We recently stayed in Seminyak for 2 days and had just a few short steps to walk down to the beach. Unfortunately, the tide had brought in a lot of rubbish and there was hardly anyone in the water.
We were told that the beach is cleaned every morning, but when the tide comes in, so does all the rubbish :(
My best advice would be to got to the beach early in the morning, just after it has been cleaned.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,148,30>===============  
The beaches all along this strip from Kuta to Seminyak need a thorough clean up. The standard is very low. It seems that all the rubbish that has no where else to go ends up on the shore line & menas plastic and all sorts of debris go into the beautiful sea - such a shame. This really lets the whole place down.

I was excited to be able to walk to the beach from our hotel, but sadly when we arrived it was covered in trash. There was no clean space, we walked for maybe 15 minutes and found no solace from the trash, even used syringes. It's sad that Seminyak cannot keep its beaches clean.

I've been around the world and been to many beaches in many countries both poor and rich. This is by far the most disgusting, upsetting and disturbing thing I have ever seen. The beach is literally covered in garbage. Swimming in the ocean there is garbage floating everywhere. You should not come out of the ocean with a plastic bag wrapped around your foot, cigarette packages, yogurt containers, you name it. Apparently it's all coming from Java the main island, but I've been told it's been happening for a long time. Honestly it is very upsetting. Don't come here unless you're happy to stay in your hotel at the pool If you're a beach person avoid at all costs. Go literally anywhere else.

I arrived on 27/12 and this was my first trip to Bali. The beach was filled with rubbish, which I learnt soon enough happens every year in Seminyak. The sand was the colour of dirt - not very enticing to lay a towel on! It was a shame that the hotel I stayed in employed guys to "clean up" the rubbish, but this literaly involved pushing the stuff further up the beach, either out of view of the hotel guests, or just far enough so that when the tide came in, it took the rubbish back out into the sea! Really disappointing that this hasn't been dealt with considering it happens every year.

I was in Seminyak in the winter 2014 and was already shocked then by the incredibly dirty beach and ocean. The sewage is running straight into the sea on various points along the beach. This has not changed at all from my first visit.
The long ring road Jl.Drupadi at the time as in a horrible condition with sewage canals left and right from the street with the appropriate smell and moscitos, rats etc.
This road was now completely redone with small but nice sidewalks now covering the mentioned canals. However, the sidewalks are usually parked with lots of motorbikes so that one still has to go down on the street all the time.
And still by walking the streets, there is nothing changed with trash piles all over the place. At each street corner you see them and nobody seems to bother. In contrary, when you tell the locals about it, they blame the tourists but my observations where that it is actually themselves throwing plastic bags, food containers, bottles and all other kinds of trash whereever they stand and walk.
The same goes for the beach...dont tell the locals as they will explain you that the trash comes because of the storm and wind and coming from the neighboring islands. And even if the trash comes from another planet: CLEAN IT UP !!!!
Tourists have choices.. For the long flying time from Europe, you would expect paradise but coming into horror.
We had a similar island in the mediteranean called Mallorca which was developped for tourism very early, similar to Bali, with the same negative aspects. But they have learned it the hard way and changed their approach to tourism almost 20 years ago by imposing taxes on tourists, cleaning up the entire island, building trash incineration plants, building water desalination plants, since they also had a major water problem, building proper roads and a great pubic transport system.
This island is now an example how it can move from a current Bali standard into something called a true vacation paradise..but of course it does not come cheap and it will turn away certain types of tourists and will take time. I wish that Bali takes this step too otherwise it will be a lost paradise !

Filthy beach with an eye-popping amount of debris that went as far as the eye can see. We paid for beach chairs (IDR 100,000 for a pair of them after bargaining!), then though of running into the sea when we got too hot, then changed our minds when we saw the sheer amount of rubbish and sewage around. We were all too happy to get out after that.

Not a place you would want to spend the day for sure, seems a bit grubby and there is a lot of rubbish - wave and big and powerful so good for surfing but maybe not families.

If you do want to go to the beach walk along and to a part of the beach in-front of the posh hotels as it seems they pay people to clean up those sections.

not really the paradise beach you hear about

Appalling place. Our second visit & we hoped it was cleaned up, but it's worse. Kilometres of beach covered in plastic bottles & rubbish. We went in the water - full of sewerage & other rubbish, it'd be dangerous to your health to swim in it. The locals don't seem to care & they blame the tourist boats but don't even clean it. What should be a beautiful place is far from it.

It's a sad example of rampant development & apathy. We'll never go to Bali again. It's ruined.

We chose Seminyak for our honeymoon stay as it supposed to be one of the best beaches on Bali, but were very much disappointed to say the least. We met only pollution with plastic, huge mountains of rubbish on and next to the beach about which locals say it comes from China. Also it is very crowded and very loud. In June 2016 most of the time swimming was prohibited due to huge waves and every 100m stinky sewage water was led into the ocean. It is a tragedy that the awareness about the unbelievable environmental damage is that little...

It's an ok beach but Kuta and Legian are much better. There is a big undertow which puts so much sand in the water. There were some good sets of waves so the surfers might like it. There is a good little bar 707 in the batubelig area that is worth a beer after a swim or surf

When we planned our trip that beachs in bali would be like the once in Thailand, nice, blue, calm. However when we arrived here we realized that its not the same. If you are someone, who enjoys the beach.and don't use that term loosely, I do mean the beach and not a beach side resort, then think again, the waves are very loud and the shore is choppy. You can't even sit on the beach cause sand gets so hot that you'll burn your self. Very disappointed.

I was told by a local that at this time of year, the winds and the tides bring in all the rubbish. Better beaches to be found at Nusa Dua during this period of the year.

The sand gets all over our face and eyes! Lucky my 3yo and I wear our sunnies so it helps us to see a bit clear.

We made sand castle but the beach is so dirty that we only spent 15-20mins there. There is no shower facility to clean up too. Not sure why this beach is popular but I guess not for little ones.

Or maybe I chose the wrong area of the beach. Won't be coming back.

Went to Seminyak and stayed at the RoyaB Beach for a week. The beach was a disgrace covered in filth and apart from a couple of hotels trying but losing, there was no pick up of the piles of stinking garbage mounting up on the beach. I have never seen a beach that was so trashed and no one seemed to care.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,156,30>===============  
we went down to the beach area restaurants to meet up with friends for dinner and there are loads of eating areas with great food.took a beachfront walk to friends hotel and the beach is probably the most littered beach i have ever walked along. you could not help but not to walk on plastic drink containers. worst beach around i cannot see how the people could be proud of this area absolutely a disgrace.

Arrived In Seminyak hoping to visit the beach area. Noticed large amounts of rubbish spread everywhere. Not appealing at all. Once of the dirties beaches I have come across. The locals make an effort to clean it up but it's really bad!

It was a huge disappointment to see this beach lined by plastics and garbage all along the shoreline. A complete eye sore!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,156,40>===============  
Stayed in Seminyak for 7 nights and loved the restaurants on offer - all cuisines. Walked the beach every day and enjoyed the early morning tranquility. Had a sunset evening at Potato Head by the beach and this is a must do.

The beach was really clean even with the past storms that had happened. They had cleaned it up nicely! The sand was nice between my toes and the Beach was really happening. There are a lot of lovely restaurants around this area and an easy walk from my hotel.

This was the beach closest to us. It's pretty crowded. I can see why some people would call it dirty with all the tourists around. I'm sure Bali can offer you better beaches. Not really a must see.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,156,10>===============  
We were shocked at the amount of plastic and rubbish that is washed up on the beach in front of our accomodation in Seminyak. It looked like a land fill tip site. Every day teams of locals trawl through the rubbish sorting organic waste from plastic, chopping up driftwood the size of tree trunks with chainsaws and bagging up rubbish in plastic bin liners, piling it up on the sand dunes, only for it to be washed back into the ocean at high tide. I can't believe the hotels along the beach don't help with the rubbish removal. Time for big business to make a stand and say NO to plastic and commit to cleaning up this beach for the sake of the locals who rely on tourism for their livelihood. I won't be coming back to Seminyak.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,156,30>===============  
Seminyak beach is lovely at sunset however any other time of the day it is quite busy and basically just another beach in Bali. It is pretty dirty and quite busy with tourists.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,156,10>===============  
Went here as soon as I arrived in Seminyak and it's probably one of the most dirtiest beaches I've ever seen in my life. I had a surfing lesson and the waves were good, but every now and then you get caught in rubbish. Most of it comes from the sea, apparently mostly from Java (at least, that's what our surfing instructors told us). It's good to see the local people making an effort to clean it up though. The sunset is quite pretty as well if you try and overlook the rubbish along the shore.

Dirty and full of rubbish. Do not swim as storm water and sewage would be of concern. Very quiet when we were there as l guess people didn't want to risk it. Lots of lounge seats to hire with water buckets at the end to clean your feet. Massages also offered.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,157,10>===============  
What a disgrace. We should all feel guilty as we are all responsible for it. Rubbish as far as the eye can see. Mostly plastics and mostly food-related, eg. straws, yoghurt pouches, bags. It is unfathomable how businesses like Potato Head and Ku De Ta survive surrounded by such filth. If I had booked a holiday at a beachside resort in the expectation that I'd be lying on the beach and swimming in the sea every day, I'd be devastated.

This poor planet of ours is slowly choking to death and Seminyak Beach is evidence of that...
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,157,10>===============  
Full of rubbish. No fun for little children looking to play in the sand. Do not suggest going there unless you've heard about a massive clean up. Jimbaran and other beaches are probably better.

I have never seen the beach so dirty, kudos to the Balinese for trying to keep it clean but the water is loaded with plastic, paper and wood. Sad
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,157,20>===============  
It's quite upsetting that the beach was filled with trash. EVEN WHEN YOU'RE SWIMMING IN THE SEA! They're literally everywhere. The only upside there was the ambience, & my pizza was good. It gets crowded but you can still find a private spot.

I went there to catch the sunset & it was awesome. The waves were huge and strong. It was incredibly windy.

I don't know if it was the time of the year or if it is always like this nowadays, but the astonishing quantities of dirt and rubbish, piling up in mountains in the beach is totally disappointing to say the least.
Seminyak is the first spot we hit on Bali once we arrived to our honeymoon. It is so sad to see the ocean and the waves carrying such amazing quantities of rubbish.
We took a taxi and went to sanur, were it was much better...

The view is extraordinary. A mountain close to the beach is always beautiful. Beach gives a beautiful view of the sunset. A calm and serene location with a lot of cafes on the edge of the beach allows us to take a good view of the sunset and enjoy the drinks

Rainy season, all the trash just goes down to the sea during heavy rain. Also some sewer water goes right into the ocean. I don't recommend this beach.

Bringing high expectation, me and my family with 2 young ones were quickly disappointed when we arrived. The whole beach was filled with litters. The sand wasn't smooth for children. The wave was huge and dangerous for children. Overall, it may be only good for jogging.

No so populate as Kuta with surfers, as Nusa Dua with russian swimmers. Nice place to relax and view sunset. The waves are big, and a lot of garbage are thrown on the beach from the ocean, but thats common issue for whole Bali. You mostly can't swim here, but you can experience the waves hitting you :)
Seminyak itself is the best place for eat and drink and party. Enjoy!

Been to Bali many times and this is my saddest visit. Washed up on the entire stretch of the shore (Kuta beach, Legian beach and Seminyak beach) are trash. Trash dumped by humans from Indonesia's mainland and now washed up on the once lovely beaches of Bali.

One can't even walk out through the whitewash or paddle out without having plastic bags, ropes or strings wrapped around one's legs or arms.

Plastic wrappers, condom wrappers and bottles are amidst some of the trash dumped and washed up. It's too much trash to list them. Let the photos speak for the once beautiful beaches of Bali. I'm very saddened to see how we humans have failed to love Mother Nature.

This place is the restaurant of GrandMas, so we try almost everything (we spend almost 15 days)

The food was really great, always good service and chilled live acoustic music in the afternoons

We suggest to try the breaks fasts and tapas.

I think is good price for the food, but there is different places to eat for the same money, so you have to choose. I recommend some tapas and beer in the afternoon

Enjoy

Like the rest of the beaches on this stretch it is diety and has heaps of rubbish at this time of year. Good to walk along at low tide though.

This beach is much more quieter than others. Which makes it much more pleasant. They have lounge and umbrella rentals for those wanting a lazy day at the beach. Take a taxi here. It's not far from seminyak square, but the roads are a killer for pedestrians. Taxi is cheap. Ask driver first. Some will try and rip you off. Although they are still cheap too.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,159,20>===============  
Avoid - unless you are a beer swilling night club loving person with no appreciation for the environment. The food options are great is the only plus. Narrow congested streets, like Asian Benidorm - a Mecca for the crass and tasteless

Nice beach with warm water and grey (not white) sand. Lots of tourists and locals enjoying the day and watching the sun set.
Locals selling kites and necklaces with out too much hassle.
It is not as good as white sand beaches of many countries but how can you complain when the water is warm and the sun is setting with a nice cooling breeze as the sun sets.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,159,40>===============  
The beach has black sand and some fair waves that i saw quite some people surfing.
It is not that crowded in the morning, but it gets super full and colorful nearing sunset.
The beach was filthy in the early morning, mostly rubbish from the previous night (it gets pretty festive), but they clean it daily until it is fairly clean.

It could have been the worst day of the year to arrive but Seminyak beach was a mess of rubbish, black dirty sand, fowl smells and more rubbish washing in from the sea and from the open sewer / drain / creek that opens onto the beach beside the Royal Beach Seminyak resort. Apparently this happens during the wet season. We retreated to Sanur where the beach is pristine - but no surf.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,160,30>===============  
We normally stay at Seminyak as we like the shops and restaurants around this area. However, the beaches in Seminyak are mainly black sand beaches and is not quite what you would expect if you are more used to white sand beaches. As such we do not normally spend time at the beach here or swim in the sea if we come to seminyak. If your preference is for white sand beaches, then Nusa Dua may be more your cup of tea.

Being in the west part of Bali, the beaches here do offer good sunsets in the evenings.

We had in our heads that we would be down the beach all the time .. unfortunately the beach was so full of rubbish in and out of the water that the only swimming we did was at our pool in the villa .. disgraceful that it is a tourist destination and there is so much plastic and rubbish everywhere !!!!! Yuck
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,160,40>===============  
We went all around Bali, the beaches in Seminyak are large and long. Many beach clubs where you can or must rent beds. Water seams fair. The sand has not the loved white colours but a classic brown as you find by us in construction. Nothing is perfekt but sure nice

=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,160,20>===============  
A difficult one to score beacuse on the one hand to sit on the sand and swim in the water of Seminyak beach is quite terrible. The dark sand and unpleasant surf (can be dangerous) is not really conducive to playful and enjoyable frolicking. Indeed the lack of swimmers most of the time is a testament to the less than ideal conditions. Additionally like most beaches in Bali dumping of rubbish is normal as is the vast amount of influx of rubbish from Java (affecting West coast) . Add to that the fact that dogs roam freely and you get the gist. On the other hand the beaches are what makes Bali Bali. Seminyak is where you can see the most beautiful sunsets, the view from the various eateries all along Seminyak beach is colourful with various vendors selling their wears. From colourful kites to an array of nic naks, So many colourful bean hags along the beach as you get closer to double six and virtually hundreds of colourful umbrellas at the Southern end make the beach transform from an 'ugly duckling' to a beautiful 'swan'
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,160,40>===============  
Beautifully warm surf; comfortable loungers available for hire, with bar service provided. Only complaint was the high level of wrapper, bags and similar trash in the water.

Seminyak!
A shoppers and gourmet paradise here in Bali but when the heat hits you and you just need some respite from all that heat, buy some swim wear if you didn't pack it and head for the beach just parallel to the shopping strip.

The water is warm and the breeze cool and that makes for a perfect combination to cool off.

There are ample places for internal refreshments too; water, beer, cocktails and food galore.

Lots efforts to keep the beach picked up by the community were evident, but it was still pretty trashy. I was reluctant to get in the water after a first day walk on the beach that took us through several stinky washes. I enjoyed my visit to Bali and we had great accommodations with very good food, but the beach up close was a disappointment. When veiwed from a distance it was beautiful the surf was aqua and the wave action was impressive. I thought the grey sand with evidence of the volcanic geography was unique, but smell and trash are hard to ignore. There must be better beaches than Seminyak. It was the most disappointing part of my visit.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,161,40>===============  
Beautiful spot, lots of those beach sunbeds to hire for the day to avoid sitting on the sand. It's super relaxing and tons of restaurants and bars line the sand so perfect to slip away for a bite to eat too. Beware though, you will be approached by a lot of locals trying to sell their products to you throughout the day.. Then again, you are in Bali!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,161,20>===============  
Lots and lots of rubbish and bamboo on this beach. Sand is kinda black and the water that is coming from the town into the beach smells.

I would not recommend people to go to seminyak beach if you are thinking that it's gonna be all white and clean. December is the raining season, rubbish are being washed up from the other islands to seminyak beach, it's really dirty and most of the time it's raining.

I would say the other season will be fine because it seems like a really good place for surfing and tanning.

Its a very average beach, there are so many bicep beaches along the coast.
The sand isn't that nice and theres a fair bit of rubbish around.
Lots of vendors trying to sell you stuff constantly. We wouldn't spend a lot of time here, however a walk along the beach is interesting.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,166,50>===============  
This is a great beach with a little bit darker sand because of the volcanos. Along the beach you will find the big expensive hotels where you can go for a drink. The only negative thing is for parents is that the water is pretty dangerous here. Big waves and underwater currents.

If you want a big beach with lots to offer this beach did offer a lot. Restaurants and bars everywhere all the way along, the surf is good especially for beginners and although at sunset the beach seemed very busy there was plenty of space to either walk along or chill out on one of the many beanbags. Overall a nice beach.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,166,30>===============  
There are some nice hotels / beach clubs set back from the sea front and the beach is large but lacks the intimacy of beaches in other parts of indonesia, such as in the Gili Islands
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,166,50>===============  
The beach is beautiful.

Water is warm, low tide shows the flat sand covered in a thin layer of water reflecting the sunset, worth staying until after dark for the sky lantern ceremonies!

Free parking for scooters along the small beach road and renting a beanbag is free with any food or drink (30,000RPI mei goreng / bin tang)
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,166,40>===============  
One of the best places in Bali to watch the sunset. Ku De Ta and Potato Head are hotspots to watch the sunset with some nice food and a drink.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,166,40>===============  
If you would like to enjoy a perfect sunset on a budget, I suggest Seminyak Beach over Kuta or Jimbaran as you don't need to spend a lot to enjoy yourselves.
There are lots of bars selling cheap beers on the beach. The best thing is that they even have bean bags!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,166,20>===============  
Quite crowded. Not very pretty - a bit dirty. Can be good for some water sports - saw people taking beginner's surfing classes, surfing on their own, water ski etc.

Maybe this is the best beach in Bali. I went to all of them and considering the cleanliness, size, and surroundings, in my opinion this is the best.

Do not recommend Seminyak beach. It is under reconstruction with lots of work going on. Choose another beach!

super crowded with tourists and surfers. daybed are for rent at 100,000rp if you are not at your hotel beach clubs. lots of peddlers selling goods. many that offers surfing lessons. overall, sunset view is great.

I would like to visit this place every time I come back to Bali. If you want to chill with your friends then this is the place to go. Sadly couldn't experience sunset but I can imagine the beauty it would add to the already beautiful surrounding.

this is a nice beach.....was a little too wavy when we were there in November but good for surfing. Lots of beach chairs for rent. Only negative is there a lots of local trying to sell everything......hats, manicure, scarfs, goods, fruit etc. They are very persistent so beware to keep your head down and if you buy anything then all vendors will be over to visit and try their luck
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,167,40>===============  
It is nice for sunset but rather busy so I'm sure you will find another beach which is less busy. But good options to relax with lots of bars and chairs

Being Australian and spoiled by our pristine beaches, I still enjoyed an early morning run and/or an afternoon stroll on Seminyak Beach, which was only a short walk from where I was staying. In the evening there was plenty of atmospheric lounging on the beach where you could wine and dine on the many bean bags and listen to great chill out tunes.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,167,30>===============  
Not my favorite beach. Lots of people using beach to walk dogs (no problem with that) but not picking up poo (big Problem with that) Long beach and sand gets darker the nearer the Volcanic ash. At the entrance I arrived at had bucket with water and ladle to wash your fee,t nice touch.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,167,50>===============  
During the night all beaches in Seminyak are full of big colorful pillow, each bar has a live band and all cocktail are very cheap!!
The atmosphere is awesome..
That was our first activity in Bali.. A nice mojito on the beach, 30 degrees... What else?
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,167,40>===============  
This is one of the highlights for us when we have visited Bali. Sitting on a beanbag, watching the sunsets, while enjoying a cold drink from one of the many bars is just so relaxing. The downside is that you get hassled by lots of people trying to sell you sunglasses, hats, watches, paintings, massages, bracelets, manicures, pedicures, bows and arrows, tasers, lazers and all kinds of Knick Knacks. They can be very persistent but generally a polite "Sorry, no" is enough and they will move on.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,168,30>===============  
There are so many great beaches in Bali..give this one a miss if you can.
I'm not sure if it was just the time of year that we were there but there were pretty significant waves breaking near the shore that make this beach difficult to actually swim at. If you enjoy body surfing (or actual surfing) and aren't scared of large waves you might like it here.
Also the beach had lovely sun loungers set up all along it that you have to pay to use. You could set up on the sand but it's kind of awkward setting up between the loungers and the sand is really hot. The loungers are expensive and while laying on them you are constantly harassed by vendors selling knock off sunglasses, cheap "jewelry", and sarongs. The vendors were non stop and really took away from the enjoyment.
Bali has tons of quiet white sand beaches with minimal break, I think it's worth it to put in the effort to find one near you instead of Seminyak Beach :)
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,168,50>===============  
very nice beach and busy but not so crowded. many good bars at the beach to enjoy the sunset by a cocktail.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,168,40>===============  
...Enjoy!

The beach and view is similar to most beaches, but unfortunately there isn't my cleaning going on. Sadly there is a lot of people leaving their left over rubbish.

This doesn't ruin the whole beach, just the initial walk up. Once you past the small line of rubbish, you forget it was there and the beach is stunning. Great view as you would expect and in November the waves crashing slightly heavier, which makes for a lovely sound and feel. Just be careful as riptide is quite common.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,168,40>===============  
Not much crowd at this beach, went from 12nn-3:30pm (maybe that's why)

The sand is bloody hot so be sure to be in your flip flops at the very least. Tides/waves were 6/10 in strength. Beginner surfing lessons available here so the wave strength is ideal.

More private as it's not as famous as Kuta beach for example but this area is where the more pricey accommodations are.

If you want to relax and have a tan or enjoy the sunset here, there are beach chairs and umbrellas along the stretch of the beach BUT a payment of 20,000 Rupiah per person is required (approx. USD2).

Also, a lot of lovely places to eat facing the sea along this stretch.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,168,40>===============  
The best beach I visited in Bali, both during the day & evening. Offered great food, my favourite was Capil. The hotel i stayed in had there own subbed area. The evening vibe was stunning, places to sit, eat & drink on the beach with live music.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,168,50>===============  
Excellent beach for surfing, not an ideal swimming beach as there are strong currents and waves of some reasonable force.

This beach is fairly clean but not the best in Bali. There is some trash in places but generally ok. The water is not of the blue kind due to the colour of the sand. Seminyak is a nice lively town full of good bars, restaurants and cafes. This is the heart of the bali gay scene with several gay bars.

from the airport to the hotel,the walk from the hotel to the beach and the beach in general was not my idea of bali and can defiately say I would never retun if I had to stay there a week
our fist sight of the beach was one of a few dogs emptying out and there was rubbish everywhere.On our way back to the hotel, in the main street in a gutter, was a dead cat which looked like it had been there for days if not a week or more.
On return to hotel, we contacted our travel agent and asked to move resort.
On research before we came Seminyak was supposed to be up market. NOT in my book.
I would return to Bali but not Seminyak
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,169,20>===============  
I always thought Bali would be a tropical place with nice white sand beaches. It was a ok beach but was very dirty . Dogs allowded to make a mess on beach which put me off walking on the beach with no footwear. was nice at night when hotels lit up and beach parties where in place, Excellent place if you want to surf. But needs a good clean up
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,169,40>===============  
Whilst visiting Bali we took a day trip and spent some time at the beach for a cool off.

It's a lovely sandy beach with seats and umbrellas for hire you you can just sit on the sand.

Very humid on our day but fine and the water was clean. Resorts seem to front the road then the beach.

Of course there are vendors for drinks, ice creams etc. new Parkinson g places were being built when we visited.

Lovely place to visit, take a swim and relax. A fair amount of people but not crowded.

The beach is nice, and the water is warm, and it is a great place to learn to surf. However, there are a dodgy smells and it would be nice to see a bit more care with cleaning up rubbish, etc. The locals offer goods for sale, but they don't hassle you so that is fine.

The beach in seminyak is nice but the water is very rough and not enjoyablw for swimming. We have seen nicer beaches elsewhere and for the price you pay to stay around here it is not worth it. If you are looking for a beach holiday go to the Gili islands where there are beautiful white sandy beaches and calm clear water. Also it is way cheaper and not half as crowded and if you explore the island you can find your own little private section of beach which is paradise

Ok there are more beautiful beaches in the world, with whiter sand and clearer waters ,this is true.

I loved this beach. I was travelling solo for a bit near the end of my trip and would come here everyday for about 2 hours. Yeah you get bothered a bit, but just be assertive with your "nos" and they'll leave you alone. The water was pretty wavey when I was there, loads of people were about with their surfboards/ paddle boards. You can rent a beach lounger for about 50,000 if you haggle - otherwise you'll be given a flat rate of 100,000.

Many of Bali's beaches have a lot of coral and rocks, Seminyak is the MOST beautiful, comfortable beach I visited on our 2 week trip. All beaches in Bali are beautiful, but at Seminyak, you can walk out hundreds and hundreds of feet and still touch. I loved that.

The sand and beach are so clean and smooth, it was such a nice alternative to all the other rocky beaches surrounding and the Gili Islands. The rocky beaches are great for photos and are beautiful, but sometimes you just want to swim or lounge and not worry about cutting your feet or getting knocked into rocks. Seminyak is perfect for that. We spent days on this beach enjoying every moment of it.

Lots of baby crabs at night that sometimes pop out during the day, but it was cute and fun. LOVE THIS BEACH, can't stress enough.

One part of bali I really look forward to is heading down to Seminyak beach to see the sunset. You have so many bars and food to choose from, or just choose from the live music where you want to sit.

Seminyak beach is okay and good for long walks but it is not very clean. Also the hawkers selling all kinds of things can be too persistent and lounging on a sunbed reading a book can be a big challenge. They constantly approach the tourists even if you say no many times.

Great waves... good for jumping around in it. Beware of beach benches that people flog out for IDR100,000 per bench. You may think it belongs to the hotel, but they don't. Also the sand is extremely hot when you step in it during mid-day. Scorching. Have to wear footwear.

It feels like in Kuta or Jimbaran. Will be jammed in high season. Plus things, because it's Hotspot so easier to reach, many type of rentable beach stuff are available such as umbrella, bean bags, etc.

As far as beaches go it was ok, not busy, only at occasional patches where there were bar shacks there are no trees or bushes/shrubs. Hardly any sellers driving you mad. Too rough to swim with huge big waves and swell, so it's great if your a confident surfer but if not then you had better stay safe and stick to having a paddle lol lovely for a stroll in the evening or watching people setting off the candle/glow lanterns into the night sky

This beach is very long. We did not walk right up to the surfers part but could see surfers on the waves. Not far from where we came onto the beach we hired clean loungers and an umbrella. 200000for the day or 150000 for three hours for the two loungers and umbrella. The waves were fun and the water warm. Further along were hotels with all their umbrellas and loungers, overlooking the beach. The sunsets were beautiful.

Do you want to swim in trash? If not then stick to the pool in your hotel. This beach is gross. We preferred batu belig further up however it still had rubbish floating in it and lots of broken glass on the beach. Unless you are desperate to swim in the surf don't do it.
However the many warungs on the beach are a nice place to sit and view the surf (without trying to swim in it)

A nice beach to look at especially at sunset, but you can smell the sewage flowing into the ocean via the creeks/outlets along the beach. I shudder to think what you would be swimming in. So we didn't swim at all.

The beach is great during the day for surfing and swimming, you can rent an umbrella and lounge. There are plenty of cheap restaurants and food and drink vendors.
From about 5.30 onwards the restaurants bring out bean bags and you can sit back and watch the sunset. Most of the bars have music and some have live music.

The beach it's self isn't the cleanest (as with most of Bali). There is a lot of rubbish but otherwise there are lots of chairs to hire for the day, people selling snacks and drinks.
Lovely spot to catch a sunset and join in on a game of beach soccer with the locals.

Not nearly as dirty and disgusting as Kuta beach. Not as nice and calming as Jimbaran beach. Annoying hawkers every 2 minutes and expensive beach chairs (prices quoted to us ranged from 150,000 for all day to 150,000 for 2 hours).

The waves here are good for surfing. Not practical for unsupervised children.

If you stay nearby and have already been to Jimbaran beach, it's worthwhile.

We went to the beach the day we landed in Bali . We had walked quite a bit and were very tired and thirsty. We sat down at one of the many places offering drinks and a bite to eat . They were playing some nice music. What we found unique was that part of the seating was bean bags and we really relaxed and enjoyed the evening with drinks and some snacks and found our exhaustion vanishing.

Iconic beach, no white sands. A lot of vendors bothering you.
Not entirely clean, seen better beaches, quite touristy. Untidy beanbags. Roaming dogs.
In general ok, good for young people, noisy and a lot of Australians.
Must not forget Bali/Indonesia is a relatively poor country. I am pleased for the locals that tourism brings much needed revenue. On the whole enjoyable but with some reservations.

We parked up our rented moped at this beach right next to the Anantara hotel just after 9.30am, put our towels down in the beach, swam, walked, sunbathed etc. It came to lunchtime so we got back on the moped to find somewhere to eat. As we were getting in the moped 2 locals came up to us saying we have to pay for parking (there were no signs, no barriers and these guys weren't wearing anything official they just had some yellow paper that had 'parking 2000 rupiah' typed on them. We said we were leaving now anyway and that there are no signs and no one was here when we parked up so started to leave, thy kept shouting at us and started swearing "**** you!" Considering how lovely and friendly the Balinese people are I was really worried and concerned by the whole experience. At double six beach (where we opted to go after this incident) there is a proper barrier and booth with guys who take the parking charge so that is fine, but who these guys were I have no idea. Horrible experience.

This beach is good to visit during early mornings. The tides just prepare to rise and the beach is filled up with joggers. You can go for an early morning surfing classes here. The beach starts getting crowded from 09:00 am onwards.

This aside, wonderful to sit by the beach and watch and listen to the crashing waves.

On Bali's west coast this is a dramatic stretch of beach, with a lot of quality hotels behind. It is in contrast to Kuta to the south, which is more raucous. Good surfing for beginners, if that's your thing. We went for a good hour's walk every morning, and were often back in the evening for a sundowner while watching the spectacular sunsets.

There is a temple at the Petitenget end and you will often witness religious ceremonies and music of various types.

I wouldn't bring kids to Bali for a beach holiday, as the sun is just too strong. With a decent base tan when we arrived, there were one or two days when we were a bit red at the end, even after a walk on a rare cloudy morning.

Subject to that, this is a wonderful place. Work continues to tidy up the surroundings. We wouldn't have missed our daily fix.

We went down to the beach today to take advantage of our Hotels Beach Club facilities and I would recommend if you are staying at the Haven Hotel whilst in Bali to utilise this facility.
The beach itself offers a great chance to body surf , board ride or boogie board as there was a constant wave.
The beach is for those with medium to above swimming skills because the surf is quite powerful and there at times is a strong undertow and rip which could trouble those with not so good swimming skills.

Seminyak beach is beautiful and stretches for several kilometers. It is quite clean and have nice sand. It is also quiet compared to other beaches in Bali, but you can still rent sun beds and umbrellas. Many resorts are located along the beach, and at night there's some bars putting out tables and chairs. Make sure to visit La Plancha. The beach is not good for swimming though. The currents are too strong, so you shouldn't really swim here. That is too bad. But beautiful beach.

The beach is suitable for surfers, swimmers and tanners. While it is best suited for surfers, because of it's high waves, I thoroughly enjoyed swimming through the waves instead. There are several small restaurants along the beach, as well as local venders, henna artists and masseuses. Topped off with soft black-ish sand and a strong Balinese sun, this beach is worth a visit if you're staying in or near Seminyak.

Beautiful beach nice sand but very little shelter no chairs like Kuta and the sea was to rough in the two weeks we were there to swim during the day we wold end up getting a cab to Kuta or in the pool at potatoe head if you could fit

I am indifferent about Seminyak beach, if your looking for a nice quiet white sand beach that you want to relax on and get some sun, then it's not for you, try looking elsewhere in Bali. There is a lovely spot outside the Oberoi that is quiet as they ban loungers and parasols. At sunset the view is amazing and we have been a few times to watch it. It's fun watching the surfers and the people watching etc.

You can't swim in the seas as its too dangerous and you will be pulled in by lifeguards. There is plenty to do, ku de ta is buzzing and looks like a good place to chill and drink with music.

Weekend was rammed with locals and tourists, but there is enough quiet spots if you look for them

We enjoyed the view of Seminyak beach from the Legian hotel.

Pros - warm water, not to many hawkers, sand dark but not black sand as we know it, felt safe

Cons - rubbish on the beach, some stray dogs which were easily avoided, streams flowing to sea across beach smelly, surf too rough when we were there to swim

Looked fantastic from the hotel pool but wasn't a swimming option for us.

Nice clean beach, lot of people and warungs, big waves, nice spot to learn surf. Nice sand. Easy access and free. Some itinerant sellers.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,184,30>===============  
Our hotel was situated on the beach. The waves were pretty awesome most of the time so if you're not experienced with beaches than its best to stay in shallow water. The sand is very black and you end up with dirty feet. There's heaps of dogs so obviously they urinate and poop on the beach (we saw this happen a bit) so you need to be careful when you're walking. The local people have lounges that you can rent during the day and beanbags at night. There are lots of people coming up to you and trying to sell you things so it's not overly relaxing. There's always places to rent boards from or learn to surf and places where you can get a drink of you want. The beach isn't very clean and there's lots of rubbish and offerings floating/blowing around. The beaches are ok if you've never experienced beaches but if you've been lucky enough to come from a country or area where the beaches are clean with white sand you won't be very impressed.

The beach was absolutely beautiful! We arrived just as the sun was setting. My biggest complaint was the amount of people on the beach. Couldn't walk in any particular direction, had to zigzag the whole time. Also, you had to cross a small stream to get onto the beach, which was awkward.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,184,50>===============  
Fabulous beach for cooling off with a nice walk along the shore.. the waves are huge and not really an ideal swimming beach, however it is still beautiful and definitely worth walking. There are a few sewage spot which are not very nice but overall its beautiful!!!

If you wanna do beach bumming then this beach is excellent for that. Have a beer at one of the bars on the beach, listen to the sound of the waves. But don't dream about swimming.

Seminyak Beach offers great sunset views. Coupled with so many beach bars along the whole stretch, we had an amazing time just cradling our beers on the colourful bean bags on the beach on one of our nights in Bali. The waves were good for surfers too! Will definitely come to Seminyak Beach again.

Beautiful beach with loads of chilled out beach bars offering live djs, music and dancers. Drinks are reasonably priced and sunsets to die for. Perfect for surfers and great fun for everybody else.

Great people watching here. Tons of places to rent chairs and umbrellas, get a beer or some food. If you want peace and quiet this isn't the place for you as there are tons of locals selling selfie sticks, sarongs, sunglasses, you name it. After saying no once they will keep coming back thinking that you might have changed your mind in the 15 minutes that they were away from you :-) The surf is amazing. As the tide goes out in the afternoon the beach expands and you can go way out and the water will only be at your ankles. This is also the place to be nighttime as at sunset it gets crowded with people hanging out at bars and restos on bean bags, having cocktails and taking selfies. Then after sunset it takes on a more club feel with cool music and just a very relaxed Bali vibe.

Stopped at the Juice Bar for a drink and a bite to eat. Lots to watch on the beach with good waves for the surfers. Usual vendors along the beach. Water was warm but a lot of the beach is too rough for swimming. Great beach to wander along.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,185,50>===============  
The beach at Seminyak is busy with access to the sea front hotels and the other accommodations with clear access offering beach front bars and places to eat suitable for all. The sea is well suited for surfers but during periods of the day also suitable for swimmers as long as they abide by notices and do not venture out too far.
The sunset views over the beach are amazing with the waves crashing and the reflections from the setting sun shown up n the shallow waters.
A must to see if you are in this area.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,185,40>===============  
Nice place to get Beer or chilling while see the sunset. Some good and cheap restaurant around. Kinda busy

It may not be as nice as some of the white beaches in the south of Bali and you will never be alone here, but for families this is a good beach to relax, with food, massages, drinks and everything you need at hand. There are no rocks in the water, just watch the current during outgoing tide.

The surf is good for beginners, so a nice place to have a lesson. On good days the waves can be good even for more advanced surfers, but chances are you'll find more quality breaks further south or west...

With all the luxury resorts, i expected more. To windy to relax. To dirty to enjoy a dip. General garbage and small plastic balls (frigolit). Kuta is so much nicer actually.

Spent the afternoon and evening on the beach here and had an amazing time.

Sea is ideal for surfers so the water is a bit rough with plenty of waves but had so much fun in the water.

Came here specifically for the sunset on the beach and we weren't disappointed! Beanbags are brought out late afternoon for you to relax and enjoy a drink while you watch.

This beach gets a massive thumbs up from me.

The beach has just enough people to be a great place for people watching, but not so many that you fee crowd in any way. The ladies and gentlemen selling their goods along the beach are not too agressive and who doesn't want to enjoy a mango or pineapple.
The beachbeds are comfortable and placed apart in a very desirable distance. The shoreline is evasive...you have walk out a distance to get any depth. This was by far my most relaxing beach experience in a long time. The bars that surround the beach have a great variety of food and beverages to enhance your beach bumming.

A place that is really good for sunbathing during the day and for chilling during the night. The beach has a lot of restaurants by the beach with live music that you can choose.

Waves can be large so its not great for swimming. Best thing to do is rent a chair (around 200,000 for two) and umbrella to watch the sun set. Not too many tourists and it is very relaxing. Dog walkers and joggers also around

The beach was not too busy on the day we visited. We did not go to Bali to visit beaches but we thought we should at least have a look. The beach was beautiful and clean and you could clearly see where to swim between the flags. i did not go in as i was terrified by the waves but lots of others were swimming. We did not get hassled on the beach and there was no one selling stuff which was nice.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,186,30>===============  
The beach has lots of entertainment, nice bars and restaurants. The beach itself is ok, apart from the sewage streams that trickles down into the sea. It wasn't pleasant having to walk through them as you go along the beach front.. It smelt terrible and you couldn't help but think you're walking through ****
Apart from that, the beach is big, has lots of places to sunbathe and is apparently great for surfing (the sea is quite rough)

Absolutely beautiful. A must-visit especially for sunset (starts around 5.30pm local time). Plenty of beach bars available for beers. Beware of touting tho, and prices here can be slightly elevated as compared to what you get elsewhere. Afterall, this is a tourist spot.

We stayed in Destiny which was 10 mins walk from the beach. The beach is nice and waves are quiet strong. We loved the array of restaurants there with live music and bean bags. We just relaxed and took some pics. I was with my 1 year old so just ordered french fries and pina colada.

Its great for people who want to have party time with chilled beer.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,187,40>===============  
Surfing for beginners, ideal lounging on the beach, cheap beer from same sun bed person. Sun beds go for 100,000 though I chose to pay 50,000 for 2 hours as I didnt plan to stay there that long. Swimming is for people who enjoy tall waves.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,187,30>===============  
The Seminyak Beach has several things going for it: fine sand, a deep beachfront and non-overcrowding (unlike Kuta). However, the main drawback is that there is little else in the way of things to do. No snorkeling, no diving, no surfing etc.

One hour is more than sufficient for this beach.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,187,40>===============  
Great beach not crowded by tourists. More serene and peaceful. I stayed in Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa, and it was beyond my expectations with very warm, accommodating, and professional staffs as well as beauuuuutiful facilities.

While in Seminyak for a short holiday visiting the beach was a must. Awesome sunset, live bands all along the beach, fresh grilled corn knobs and boiled peanuts absolutely delicious. It was hard to choose from the many inviting places to have a meal. Ended up at D'Goglo. Yummy food eaten on small table and bean bags on the beach. Loved it.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,187,30>===============  
Seminyak beach is a premier location to relax and enjoy the mix of sands, sea, surf and nightlife in Bali. Hawkers are friendly and not overly intrusive; an inevitable part off tourist culture. Lots of food on offer and they live music is a treat; from soft rock to folk to blues, old school festival feel with the sounds of the rhythmic pounding of the surf only metres away. Fantastic sunsets perfect the scene. Like all good parties it comes to an end with the resulting mess on show at daybreak, to be swept up ready for the next party to begin.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,187,40>===============  
It was an overcast day when we ventured out but it was peaceful enough strolling along the shore and checking out all of the restaurants facing the beach. The sand was a sort of grey and a bit scratchy but ok to walk on. There was a bit of surf and a few surfers and wind surfers in the water which was ok to paddle in. Not sure if i'd hang out on a deck chair on the beach but maybe if it was linked to a resort I might give it a go.

This beach is very difficult to access unless you are staying at the W Hotel as this is about the best place to access it from.

The only access is via the Ku DeTa restaurant. Then you have to walk down broken and dangerous steps to get to the beach.

We went to the beach a few times. We found it hard to access the beach and walked for awhile before being able to enter and same with when we walked along the beach we found it hard to exit.

Hey there
I have been to Bali many times. During my recent stay my friend and I needed to exchange Australian dolllars and did so at an "Authorized Money Exchange" who advertised no commission

The money was counted in front of us and placed on the counter.

Lucky for us i recounted the money only to find it was substantially short

When I questioned this the seller took the money back and recounted the correct amount

With over 30 years cash handling experience i was baffled at how i could have miscounnted. ..so i recounted and again it was short!!!

I decided not to go ahead and walked away. After speaking with other travelers they also had this experience.

Its a scam and its like magic...like professional card players the money disappears in front of your eyes.

Once the money is counted for you...hold it in your hands and recount it and then DO NOT LET it go....not for a second as they are so quick!

They will try to distract you by asking you for change saying that they don't have any...walk away as the legit mkney exchange has chsnge

They lure you in by offering a better rate

Safe travels all

Good to spend the afternoon here watching beautiful sunset across the sea. They have lots of cafes stretching alongside the beach where you can sit and relax with some fresh cocktails.

Staying in seminyak decided to check out the beach. Only 15min walk through the streets which you could stop and barter if you wanted to. Then the beach...wow sand surf and sun. Absolutely beautiful. We are in here now (early September 2016) and the weather is gorgeous. Water warm no sandflies....a few hawkers but l wanted a serong so called one over. Next minute, the watch guy and jewelry lady were right there....didn't even see them coming haha. If you just be polite and firm with the No they get it.

After being told that the beaches in Seminyak weren't that nice, i was slightly worried as i thought this may effect my holiday, however, the beach was lovely and me and my boyfriend spent most days there. The waves are very strong so perfect for surfing (if that is your thing). The only annoying thing, is you constantly have people coming up to you to sell you things. They are however very friendly!!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,190,30>===============  
Coarse dark sand and lots of rips. Good for small children as the waves roll in a long way so they can jump the smaller waves close to shore. Downside is the constant harrassment from sellers who never stop trying. Don't pay more than $10 for a day bed and umbrella, they often start bargaining at $30. Nice views.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,190,40>===============  
Close to bars and hostels, this beach is the most touristic one on the island. I guess a must see but it would be the shame to stop only to this one as for me this was not the best!

We walked the length of the beaches from petitenget to Kuta and stopped at Seminyak as it was the nicest part. There are fewer hawkers (although still quite a lot) and it is less busy but still had a great vibe. There are also restaurants on the actual sand which there aren't at Kuta. We stopped at Taris beach bar which was particularly good, with nice seating out front and very reasonable prices which included tax and service charges (unlike most places). The sand was lovely and soft (although too hot in the midday sun) and the water was great. Seemed a great spot for surfing too with lots of people learning in this area. Would definitely recommend it!

we were staying in an AirBnb Property only a couple minutes walk from Seminyak Beach so naturally we visited any chance we could.

what I loved about the beach is that despite the many visitors, it was still a nice laid back feel to it.

It was a great place to "people watch" with many people surfing or having lessons, people riding horseback, going for runs, or simply relaxing on one of the lounges offered by the restaurants.

At night beanbags and umbrellas are set up with the restaurants also offering live music.

A great place to chill!

Our young children loved Seminyak Beach - both during the day and at night.

The fact that you can't really swim in the sea, that some sewage flows down the beach and into the sea, and that the beach is littered with rubbish, makes this not the greatest strip of beach!
Maybe if you are staying at one of the beach front resorts your experience will be better, obviously it's always awesome to see the ocean. We were expecting more after reading so many great things, we thought we had missed something. The bean bag bars are the only reason to come to the coast.
Shame about the drunk people trying to light Chinese lanterns, and sellers trying to sell you random crap, it's ok just to hang at one of the bars. I think if you skip this area you won't miss much.

I want to first make a disclaimer that I went into this trip believing I would see crystal clear blue waters. Unfortunately that isn't what this beach looks like. Aside from the fact that the sand was as soft as silk the water was brown-ish. What a let down!
The water was less than a foot deep for as far as I could see. Which did make for a great place for me to make my first attempt at surfing!

All the images you have of a balinese tropical paradise, with white sandy beaches lined with palm trees and clear blue sea. Forget that.
Seminyak is an urban beach, with hotels and restaurants where palm tress should have been. And the white sand is not son white and full of litter that comes from... the sea...

Good for surfing, not so good for swimming. You have to bargain for best deal when hiring or requiring surfing lessons. The beach has one after theother of surfing stalls.

Long sandy beach stretching from Kuta, Legian to Seminyak. Less busy than the nearby beaches and not so good for surfing but excellent for chill out!

A beautiful beach and lots going on. We hired beach loungers and there were opportunities to surf etc.
However... massive warning. Be aware of the rip tides. I was pulled out of the sea by 2 life guards and another man when I was dragged back by the strong rip tide. I wasn't in deep but the surf and pull was extremely overpowering. Luckily my daughter raised the alarm and I was rescued. I was taken by ambulance to the BMIC hospital in Kuta. They were brilliant. What wonderful nurses and doctors. After spending a night in IT I was well enough to continue my holiday.
Thank God for the life guards .
So my major message is enjoy this beautiful beach but be aware of the flags . Yellow and red flags means it's ok to swim but just be aware.
Also swim near life guard spots.
Kuta beach can be the same. Be vigilant. Respect the ocean.
A massive thank you to those life guards. They surely saved my life.

The waves were gorgeous. You can admire the surfers in action. Plus it is where Ku De Ta is located, so you can pop by after playing at the beach. There is even a water point for you to wash away the sand from your feet - free for everybody. But need to be careful if you have young kids because the waves are so strong that they can suddenly swell up from ankle deep to thigh deep in just a few seconds.

This beach offers you all comforts you can imagine: high waves for surfing, glassy surface during low tide; broad beach for jogging and games, strong push back during high tide; party beach with drinks and music or calm places back of the sea; spectacular sun downs as well as tropical thunderstorms; a happy and joyful get together of all nationalities regardless of any religion...this is how beach life should look like!

you could easily reach this beach by going north from Kuta Beach. there are several restaurant that took part of this beach but you could still enjoy the beach. this beach is perfect for sport activity as the sand is soft and wont hurt your feet. the entrance fee is free

The sunset is amazing, not as many people hasseling you to buy things although ive been three times this year and Seminyak is getting busier and more expensive. Kids playing as the sun goes down is the best part of our trips here, then live music on the beach at night.

Long sandy beach, good for walking. Sun beds comfy - you have to barter, if you return for a number of days the person selling the sun beds will remember you and give a good price. We paid on average 180,000 rupiah for two beds and an umbrella from 11 am until around 5.30. You can buy ice cold drinks from the sunbed seller as well. If you like playing in the waves then this is place for you, surfing, boogie boarding- not swimming though. There are loads of locals selling their crafts. After a day on the beach the sunsets can be spectacular and the bars bordering the beach come to life with live music. We have enjoyed 10 days in Seminyak

Just love Seminyak beach at night, so much going on and so many places to enjoy the evening sunset.

I am a regular in Bali, and i would always visit this beach out of all the other beaches in Bali. Not only that it isn't so crowded, but it is clean also compared to the other main beaches in Bali. The sunsets are also nicer as compared to Kuta. Location does really play a big role. I am a big fan of sunsets.

Nice beach but not the best I've ever seen.

Never got too crowded and was more suited for a stroll than perhaps a day at the beach. The locals loved it and in the evenings it really came to life.

Sunset was beautiful and worth the visit just for this.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,195,50>===============  
I've been to Seminyak many times now and love it. The beach is fantastic, I love going to La Plancha and the other beach bars to get a mid afternoon drink in between splashing in the surf and relaxing on one of the many recliners. As the sun nears the moment of spectacular sunsets I transition to one of the colourful beanbag chairs to enjoy the view. Then, I stay at a nearby hotel so I can quickly shower, change and get to one of Seminyak's many gorgeous delicious restaurants. It's easy enough to rent a motorcycle or hire a driver to go up and around the island on longer days to view the many temples, rice terraces and other more Balinese favourite spots.

I will warn that our fellow Australian neighbours tend to get a bit crazy and exhibit at times an appalling lack of respect for the local people and other tourists. But, hey, there are many Aussies that are super charming and delightful... I love you guys. Just reign in the trashy types a bit better... frankly, it's embarrassing. We all want to have a good time in this friendly, gorgeous place... it doesn't require falling on the ground or vomiting in the bushes to make that possible. Our Indonesian hosts would appreciate your thoughtfulness as well.

Do keep in mind that Seminyak is in the trio of townships along western Bali that are most commercial and frequented by tourists. You can minimise the negative impacts of this by keeping your daily travel to a minimum, locating your accommodations close to where you want to spend most of your time and planning all day tours for yourself that start early in the morning before traffic gets really ramped up.

Seminyak beach is a great spot to relax have a quiet drink and watch another bali sunset go down. There are not as many people trying to sell you stuff on the beach here so you can relax more. I would recommend semiyak beach for drinks food and relaxation.

Many people visit Seminyak Beach to swim during the day but in the evening it's about walking along the water's edge taking in the beautiful sunsets and the many attractions along the beach. Kite surfers and horseback riders silhouetted in gold and bronze by the setting Sun made fabulous photo memories. Many ceremonies are being enacted in Bali at the moment and there was a gathering of Balinese families enjoying the twilight beach in traditional white and yellow bringing offerings and sharing the peaceful atmosphere. Wonderful moment.

Within walking distance of our villa which was great.
Easy access, choice of sun beds or just a towel on the beach.

Not the best indicator of traditional Balinese culture. Over crowded, with better beaches 30 mins away. We preferred spending time in Ubud, Keramas, Amed, Gili Meno etc. since we were after culture. Stay here if you don't want experience Indonesia. :) plenty of party spots and night life if your into that sorta stuff. :) :)

It is more expensive here with plenty of scammers than the rest of Bali. (It is part of the Kuta party scene, we heard the night clubs from our hotel).

On our two week holiday to Seminyak, the beach was our favourite place to be. Throughout the day it's no so busy so great to relax of for the kids. It tends to get busier when everyone comes to watch the sunset, one word WOW!!!!. The beach is so clean, gorgeous sand, hardly any shells, so great to walk on barefoot. The sea is amazing for waves, fab place to hire a body board or surf board. Life guards are exceptional and very observant, due to the tide getting strong at times. It's by far the best beach we have ever been on, definitely recommend.

Dirty beach, maybe a bit cleaner than Legian but still lots of rubbish everywhere on the beach. There are a few Warungs on the way as everywhere in Bali to buy beer, but not many. Quite a few beachfront luxury hotels with sea view etc. Waves are ok if you want to swim. We are not surfers so can't say anything about surfing conditions. Worth going to Echo point beach for cleaner sand and nice views

I was disappointed. There was alot of trash in the water. The surf was so strong couldn't really swim, just stand and let the waves crash around you. Lots of surfers in training, but no real waves for them to ride, waves broke before any rideable curl. There were warning flags for rip currents and if you didn't get knocked down while waves were coming in there was a big chance they were dragging you out! We got 2 lounge chairs and an umbrella for 150k and had it for as long as we wanted. Lots of people walking around selling food and souvenirs.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,197,40>===============  
Good beach, clean, nice waves up to three meters high. It can be dangerous in the water at some spots because of outwards currents but these are pinpointed by lifeguards with flags on the beach. I do freaking hate the guys working on the beach overcharging for the sunbeds and umbrella. Our hotel hostess told us 100 rp. is normal for 2 beds and an umbrella. They asked for 200-300 so we ended up with our beachtowel on the sand, which is free obviously

Seminyak beach is a dark sand beach with some famous bars, beach clubs and restaurants alongside as well as some high end hotels. Why on earth they can't look after the beach is beyond me. It's full of rubbish from visitors and vendors. If the bars weren't here, no-one would visit because there are a million other beaches that are better than this.

Not a beach swimmer ourselves, but we went for the sunset and eats. Was a hot day for this time of year.

Ok for anyone that wants to visit for their first time please understand the following

Cons:
1) the sand is not white and appears to have black volcanic ash in it
2) the water is not crystal clear nor blue it is more green / brown
3) some of the fresh water run off is full of rotting vegetation waste and stinks so bad
4) there are no free toilets
5) beach vendors wonder up and down trying to sell things. Be polite and just say "tee dack Terry Me Ka See" this means no thank you. Learn this line ASAP

Pros:
1) lots of atmosphere and great sunsets! The music is great everyone is friendly and very festival like!
2) great location and useful beach to walk from Kuta to Seminyak often quicker then riding a taxi
3) there are some great waves and it's great to learn to surf
4) there are red and orange flags for swimming with lifeguards watching to patrol (always follow their instructions)
5) there are cheap sun lounges for rent and umbrellas. The price fluctuates with supply and demand. If it's Saturday and sunny expect to pay up to $aud10.00 for 2 beds for the day! Get over it the beers are only $2.50 consider it the cheapest cover charge.

If you want nice white sandy beaches ask a local uber driver and 30 mins away you can get to a white sandy beach.

Having stayed in packed Kuta before, I thought I'd take my friend and I to the recommended Seminyak for a bit more up market lifestyle.

The beach is definitely better standard than Kuta as it is less packed, has nicer bars with nicer food and seating areas and more reasonably priced beds for the day (norm 100'000 per bed for the day).

Great bars for sunset which serve pretty decent food and some good sunsets.

However, there are constant waves here with strong currents. Swimming isn't really possible, but jumping waves is as is trying our surfing! Definitely would not recommend for families with small kids who want to swim, or poor swimmers.

Head to Nusa Dua for calmer and bluer seas with whiter sands. We did for a day!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,198,40>===============  
It's a shame we didn't get enough time here. The beach has big waves and a nice sunset. You can laze here whole day. It will be good to have public toilets (you can pay a small fee to the warungs to do your business)

We took a walk along the beach around 3km and while it is packed full of tourists and locals we were shocked to find what looked and smelled like sewage draining into the sea!
This did not seem to deter anyone tho! There are great waves on this beach and plenty of surfers but on this particular day there was a very strong undercurrent and the lifeguards were out and blowing whistles and waving the ref flags! It's a lively walk and seemed relatively safe! Many hotels border the beachfront and there are some nice bars and restaurants overlooking the sea! There is some great live music at night, nice place for drinks and dinner! Note that there are lots of pan handlers selling different things on the beach! A simple 'no thanks' and they usually leave you alone!

We stayed in seminyak for 3 days. The beach was okay, however, there was a lot of rubbish that made its way into the water. Not the best beach and certainly not the prettiest. Chairs cost 100,000 irp for the whole day. Not a bad price!

As a beach, it's got dark coarse sand, and waves. What is really nice are the many places to sit a watch sunsets
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,199,20>===============  
But it's definitely not a pretty beach! Steeply raked down to the ocean on the northern side and really quite rough with a strong drag. Definitely not a swimming beach whilst we were there in early August. Sand looks volcanic and is very dark and rough. Unfortunately, there is also a significant sewage outlet and if you're walking along the beach, there's no option but to step through it. Some significant works taking place alongside the waste outlet whilst we were there and WH&S was most definitely not on the builders list of importance so be very careful trying to get on and off the beach there.
Fairly strong security will not let you off the beach and through one of the hotels until you get all the way down to Legian or an equal distance north and about 300 m past Potato Head so make sure that you're up for a walk I wouldn't suggest Seminyak if you want a beach holiday.

we stayed in seminyak for a week and went for a walk along the beach. i was worried having read some other reviews about it being untidy, it certainly wasnt on the occasions i went! Sitting in one of the bean bag bars and watching the sunset with a dronk of your choice is a must!! Plus the beach sellers are really friendly and you can pick up a bargain too if you wish! Live music plays as you drink and watch the waves and sunset!

We loved this beach. But you can only swim on parts of the beach.The baywatch guys (sorry no busty girls in orange swimsuits) keep blowing their whistles to move swimmers to a safer place due to high current. You are pulled back into the sea by this. They leave swimmers with a surf board be, but they do not know if these are beginners of professionals. So be careful if you are not an experience surfer as the current is very strong here.

You can rent a bed for 50K and order cheap Bintang bear with these guys too. Friendly guys.

Ok this isn't your storybook beach, no white sand and light blue water here, but. It's fun, bigger than normal surf at certain times of the day, meters from most hotels, warm and just easy. It's no doubt polluted and there area some smelly steams leading into it, but not massively more than any Asian beach or if the bay's & beaches of many Australian cities like Sydney & Melbourne, just swim well away from the streams

There are two halves to the beach, from the entrance to the right is a quiet long stretch of sand and to the left is a bustling vibrant beach bar and watersports stretch. Lovely place to walk early morning, fairly empty with just a few dog walkers, joggers, surfers and yoga enthusiasts. During the day and evening it gets much livelier with the bars filling up, all competing at night to have the best / loudest live music! Food and drink can be found easily and cheaply and it's a good spot for a sociable evening / night. For surfing the waves tend to be suitable for beginners and there are a lot of surfing schools towards the far end of the beach where the moped track runs along the back. The track / road along the back of it dies get very busy with mopeds but that's Bali for you!

Seminyak ended up being my favourite beach spot! Not so crowded as its southern neighbours!! Some fine restaurants and beach bars! And that's when we start to see some quality resorts!!

Had some of the best times EVER of my life at this beach! I still remember back when all the hustle and bustle was at Kuta's Legian Beach and Seminyak seemed so quiet and far off yet the two beaches connected. As time went by and more and more people decided to make Bali home did this Seminyak beach along with one of its now world-famous establishments, KUDETA, did it explode as THE NEW beach to be at and be seen on.

The last time I must say was that there must have been some shifts in energies between the Earth, Moon and Su, because never have I ever felt such a dramatic and immense energy of the sea pulling me and my kids out so sea, not once but almost three times!

The beach looked like the tundra plains of Alaska at one stage and then suddenly huge waves as high as 2.5Meters would come crashing towards us and the many other brave ones in the sea that day. I had to hold with as much strength as I could muster as the kids were being literally dragged out to sea! Truly incredible and what an awesome sight and experience for all to witness and feel the power of Nature in all its its rawness!

Were the kids scared? Maybe a little.
Was I scared? Yeah, I think so.
Will we be back? ABSOLUTELY!!!

I love swimming here anytime of day. Before breakfast you can have the beach to yourself and if you swim out to the breakers and look back over the Oberoi hotel you can see the volcanoes in the distance when the sky is clear. During the day the beach us usually quite busy but still fun. In the evening lots of people come down to watch the sunset

One thing I had to do each morning before entering the beach was walk around the rubbish and dogs... Bali is clearly over loaded by tourism. The people are really in your face, even when your sitting in a restaurant on the beach just wanting to relax and sip cocktails... Time and time again I would get hassled and miss my sunset moment. I love Bali. But they really need to stop the hawkers as it's quite annoying and unpleasant. Also ridiculous charges to hire beach lounges! $40! For the day. Food pretty expensive on beach. Loved the live music, movies and good quality eats. Surf was ok pretty dumpy.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,203,40>===============  
We spent 2 days on the beach. We hired 2 sun lounges with an umbrella and told our host to keep the Bintangs coming! The water is super warm but beware for the rip tides and the big wave dumpers. You will be inundated with Balinese trying to sell their wares. This is part of the beach experience - definitely stop the ladies with the fruit, you won't be disappointed! Don't be afraid to eat local. Some of the best food is sold on the back of a motorcycle. There are a few pop up kitchens on the beach run by local women. This food is so cheap and fresh and ridiculously cheap. They even deliver it to your sun lounge.

TIPS:
Make sure you put on lots of sunscreen, even though you're in the shade those UVs punch through everything!
Take the time to pick your beach host - the guy trying to get you to sit on his sun lounges. Some a nicer/better than others.
You'll need to pay approx 4000-5000 RP for a trip to the toilets on the beach

Seminyak Beach is a lovely stretch of sand with waves lapping onshore. Tourists still throng the shoreline. Watch out for the occasional drug pusher as happened when I was there. Decline politely when touts approach you. Otherwise it remains a pleasant place to walk and enjoy the sea breeze. Five star hotels dot this area and they have good dining facilities if you wish to splurge on a meal.

On my first visit to Bali I went to seminyak beach and was disappointed due to the fact that it was totally unappealing there were huge King tides and it was unsuitable for swimming and relaxing .I expected the beach to be better and the waves smaller on my second visit however exactly the same .Seminyak has a good vibe and is a great area but the beach lets it down

Seminyak beach is beautiful. The sand isn't white but oh so soft. The sunset is just exquisite to watch while sitting in the bean bags provided by the local restaurants.

Nice beach to go in the morning. Clean water. Long Stretch of beach. There's a lot of sun beds but you need to pay. I don't know the price as I didn't use. There's people doing exercises, learning surfing...etc. but if you go to the side where it's near double 6 hotel the beach is less crowded.

Seminyak beach is a clean, relaxing destination to hire a sun lounge and soak up the beautiful Bali sun! The service you get in the beach is incredible....lady selling pineapples and cutting up in front of you, Bintang sold by the vendors on the beach, icy poles as you lay there....you don't have to move. The Balinese are such lovely, friendly people who never harass you to purchase their wears. I fall more in love with Seminyak beach the more times I go! Highly recommend putting your feet up and choosing this awesome beach destination!

Always something going on no matter if it's during the day to sit & relax or surf along with having a lunch or at night when the beach bars/restaurants are a buzz with live music.

Some of the eateries are better than others and can be expensive when comparing to prices in restaurants along the Seminyak strip, but the sunset ting is what you pay for, quite wonderful.

Yes those selling anything and everything can be annoying but still a worthwhile experience.

It's amazing in the evening especially after sunset as there is live band playing some music. The beach is long. They have a few of outdoor cafe with serves you some food and drinks. There is beam bags at the beach with a small table where u can enjoy the stars and lighting of the city. The locals are selling the lantern to the tourist with rph 100000 but if we buy from the restaurant waiter they can give a cheaper price. The sand at the beach is soft and sandy. It's comfortable and cooling

Seminyak beach is great fun for catching waves, learning how to surf, having a nap and lounging around. Lots of people around enjoying the same things. Water is warm, sand is clean. Many dogs in this area, walking around freely. Often they go chase each other. Very fun to watch!

Lots of seating areas. Often depending on what hotel you're in. The seats have Hotel names on them, such as Harris Hotel, Horrison and The Courtyard, etc..

Its THE best beach in Bali to spend the day with your family and friends. Its not crazy crowed like Kuta or Legian Beach. Also for me, the crowd here seemed a bit better in terms of "class" (sorry for being politically incorrect) ... but its true!!! Kuta and Legian beaches are like fish markets compared to this one.

This beach is much much cleaner and the restaurants on the beach are quite nice, nothing great but just nice. You can rent seats/umbrella for USD 20 for the whole day, surf boards are USD 7.5, body boards are USD 4 !!! There are beer guys right at the beach, they serve really chilled beers and drinks (with nuts) right to you on the sand. Its awesome.

But the best part was the water, it was warm to perfection.
We simply loved our time at the Seminyak beach. I highly recommend this one.

Seminyak beach is a very long sandy beach, not the best for swimming, in fact it is very dangerous to do so in most parts but it's great for surfing.

Firstly. Bali beaches are not a patch on beaches in Esperance Western Australia. Or even most Aussie Beaches for that matter. Now having said that it nice to sit and watch a sunset and drink a cold Bintang on the beach. And yes rubbish regularly washes up from Java with the water currents and on bad days they get tractors in to clean the beach. But in general a must thing to do is sit and relax and enjoy your holiday.

The water is lovely and warm and the photos posted show a beach paradise with gorgeous sunsets. There is no question that Bali does have places like this but the shoreline from Kuta all the way up to Canggu has a terrible rubbish problem which comes off the streets and out via the streams. I do not want to bag Bali as we have had a lovely time and the locals are amazing but do not come to Bali thinking it is pristine clean. I am not joking when I say you should make sure you have had your tetanus and Hep A shots if you plan on surfing or playing around the beach. Bali is not unique, and this problem can be found all around SE Asia but it does not make it right. If you are into surfing be prepared for the busy spots at peak holiday times.

Confession: I only went there for the sunset, so don't know how it looks or how busy it is during daytime. For the sunset, it was not very busy, but there were enough people there not to make it feel deserted. Colorful restaurants with a lot of beanbags are there to enjoy the sunset from. I particularly enjoyed the walk on the beach away from the cafes after it got a bit dark.

We lived spending time here both for swimming as well as having a party at night. Try to ignore the ever present traders or chat to them to find out about their lives ... . They are always friendly. The best time is at sunset when ons can sip cocktails and listen to live music

We have visited Seminyak beach twice - and have been twice too often! We are spoiled with pristine white sand beaches at home - so the black volcanic sand just doesnt do it for us - further the sand is all hard packed down, and the ocean regularly claims victims .
To top it off it is crowded with sun loving drunkards and locals selling all manner of tourist targeted products/services.

Seminyak beach is great for a morning stroll or for lazing with a book at La Lucciola,but don't go with the expectation that it will take your breath away.It's pretty in an understated way but not a once-in-a-lifetime beach experience.

Enjoyed getting away as we were able to get get BC flights and the CourtYard Marriott for a great price, but although the hotel was lovely, its more for families no quite areas. It rained 4 out of the 6 days. The beach spot for the hotel is too far away nea The Library on Seminyak beach. Bali used to rain then a couple of hours and then its fine, not the case anymore.
I have to say all the prices have gone up, but its still a great place. Massages are still dirt cheap, together with Taxi and all in all the food is really of a high standard. Plus no sickness at all. I love Bali so in kind og bias as ive been going for so many years. Seminyak is great shopping food and accommodation, what more can you ask for? Well nice weather would have been nice ...happy holidays!

We went yesterday at the public beach, via the Ku De Ta beach club. The sand is nice, the beach is clean, the chairs for relaxing in the sun are ok, bring your own towels and sit back enjoy the ocean. The water was perfect, hot , cool waves, had a lot of fun in the water. A perfect day at the beach. There are a lot of comerciants coming by, asking if you want to buy all kinds of things, fruits, watches, scarves, etc. Enjoy!

I'm not sure how this beach only gets four stars! Sure it's not an Australian beach but it's beautiful in its own right. A great way to walk from one location to another, always something to look at from the peanut seller, to the people hawking their wares (almost always politely), the beachside bars and restaurants, kids and families enjoying the water, day beds to settle in for the long haul of a tough day at the beach, people fishing and completely glorious sunsets.

The beach is long and is great for a walk
And superb for sunset.
Of course it would be better without the sellers. If you walk south a couple of km you will be in Kuta which is full of annoying sellers. The more north you head you find great bars and restaurants on the beach.
The long rolling waves are exquisite and it is no wonder it is famous for surfing. There are many rips which make swimming dangerous.
Great to be in a hotel or bar overlooking this beach.

This beach has great surf and plenty of sun lounges for sale at a hefty price unless you are prepared to bargain. I'm unsure of the water quality but it was warm without being a bath. Don't come here expecting white sands and blue water as you will be terribly disappointed. The tide was strong so I'm not sure I would take young children here. There does not seem to be lifeguards around. I guess I am spoiled by having some of the best beaches in the world at my doorstep in Australia. Anyhow, the surfers seemed to enjoy it.

This is a huge beach with a great selection of bars and surf board rentals. The waves are great for surfers or those who just wish to chill out. Sun beds and parasols can be rented cheaply. Sarong and souvenir sellers are a little tiresome. Pollution is a massive problem, especially during the rainy season. There is a sign that says it is a 'natural phenomenon', which is a complete lie. The rubbish is because of inadequate trash collection infrastructure and poor education and awareness about littering. Hopefully the situation will improve given recent campaigns on the island.

Seminyak attracts the higher end client with the larger resorts. But I find the beach to be dirty and smelly due the many creeks that flow into the ocean there. Nearby Legian in much cleaner.

Every second person we passed were trying to sell us surfing lessons or deck chairs. I understand they are trying to make a living but I guess if you are looking for a relaxing stroll, this is not the place. Sand looked abit dirty and grey as well (maybe it was the weather? Was overcast).

Otherwise, saw some big waves and people surfing. Wouldn't advise little ones.

Lots of restaurants etc as well but they were closed when we were there (afternoon).
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,213,50>===============  
So much fun to watch the goings on. Surfing for learners, easy peasy, lessons and boards available for rent beachside.
Grab a beanbag at a bar 5.00pm onwards to watch the sunset and the kites flying overhead. Whatever the roving vendors try and sell you offer less than half, to get to halfway. They will come down as you go up. Enjoy the bargaining and don't be mean.

Seminyak has become overdeveloped like Kuta and Legain. It's good for shopping, watching sunset and spending time a bars& cafes. There are nicer beaches in the north west corner of Bali. The beaches a bit further away are a lot nice

We went for a stroll before sunset, so maybe we missed the key feature of this beach. We liked the setting, nice sand and we didn't noticed anything dirty, as reported by other reviewers. Zero approaches from beach vendors. Nice little temple in the back, which unfortunately we were not able to visit for inappropriate clothing. Bars are everywhere: nothing uber-neat, just comfortable beanbags and lounge chairs. Rentals and surfing lessons. Overall, nice beach, seen better.

Stunning beach and perfect place to start a walk from Seminyak all the way to Kuta if your up for it or the other way around. Takes about an hour to get from Legian to Seninyak at a reasonably slow pace enjoying the surroundings which include locals playing soccer, lanterns, bean bags, musicians, beach bar after beach bar and many many other things to see and take it all in.

If you are in Seminyak you absolutely must take in the sunset at Seminyak beach. On a clear day the view of the sunset beyond the crashing waves was one of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen.
Just be aware, my partner and I went to the beach hoping to sunbathe and learn to surf, neither of which were possible as sunbathing isn't permitted on the majority of the beach (as you would be laid in front of one of the beach-side bars); also the waves are huge so swimming isn't allowed and I wouldn't surf unless you know what you're doing.

Cool and relaxed beach with a nicer vibe than kuta beach. Still the same amount of merchants but more places with bean bags and music to chill. Waves are more lenghty than kuta as well, though it depends on the time i guess

Best part of the beach was sunset. From our hotel, we could walk for 10 minutes and be in Seminyak beach where all the umbrella/beanbag restaurants were. (Beanbag beach) It was definitely pretty to see, and a good place to catch the sunset, but make sure you get a seat in the middle. We unfortunately got seated in the front beanbag chairs and were harassed by hawkers all evening long. Made for an unpleasant experience in what would of otherwise been a beautiful sunset experience.

We have been to Bali many times but always stay in Nusa Dua or Ubud. We decided to finally check out Seminyak as it certainly draws some crowds. We entered the beach area and immediately weren't impressed. The beach was dirty and it smelt disgusting like sewerage we didn't even want to take our flip flops off. Having walked only a couple hundred meters we turned around and left the beach to get away from the smell. The furnishings along the beach where also very run down and in need of an upgrade with the beach umbrellas and chairs faded and ripped.

Seminyak beach is not as crowded as kuta. Definitely a good choice if traveler want a less crowded and not noisy beach. There are people that rent beach chair for 200k/hour.

This is a typical tourist hot spot beach in Bali. Hire a longe and watch the world go by, or more likely come to you to purchase everything you may need on the beach, hats, food drinks and even a kite!

The beach is extremely long. The wave is so strong that it's twice as high as an adult height. Should be a good place for surfing. A nice spot to see sunset.

We saw a couple taking pre-wedding shoot on the beach. Probably not private enough for sun bathing. Not is a safe place for leisure swimming due to the strong wave. Sand looks pretty dark but feel soft and powdery on feet.

Had a hard time finding the entrance to the beach from the main road as the resorts were lining the stretch between the road and the beach. No clear signages for us to locate entrance as well. We finally backtracked for 4 mins and found a small entrance through Ke De Ta. Coconut was very fresh and cooling which was a big plus for a hot afternoon. But sunbed had to be haggled with the vendors (there were many of them along the beach) and we got a pair of beds at 50,000IDR for an hour. The beach was clean and nice to walk along the edge of the waves along the shoreline. It wasn't too crowded and was overall an enjoyable experience! would go back again

When you walk onto the main beach of Kuta, Legain or Seminyak they all offer similar things, beach lounges, cold beer & umbrellas but the exception is Seminyak it has more atmosphere with a lot of eateries along the beach.

I'm here now on the beach in Seminyak chilling listening to the waves. The beach is very relaxed with plenty of beds to choose from. It costs about ¬£10 for 2 beds for the day and a btl of water is about 50p. There is plenty of food places along the beach to grab a snack, they are OK for a sandwich and drink.
The sea at the moment is quite rough so be careful, the waves don't look that big but when your underneath it, it's a very different story. It is however very warm so that's a plus point. If you want to learn to surf you can do which also is cheap. The people along the beach are very friendly and we had a foot massage yesterday from Kitty who was very good, she painted my toe nails very nice also. There is lots of sellers down the beach, they mean no harm just trying to earn a living they all have hats with their names on and some stuff is ok what they are selling. I like this place because everyone is welcome and nobody cares what you look like. It's not like Cancun where you have to make an effort to go to the beach. At night the beach bars have live music where you can watch the sunset, very relaxing.‚ù§Ô∏è

This beach is great to watch the sunset and sit at one of the many beachside bars and restaurants. Most of them have cushions and beanbags to sit at and enjoy the beach views. The beach is clean but watch out for your belongings as this place has a reputation for pickpocketing. There are a lot of people on the beach trying to sell you things. It's best to bargain the price at least to 50% and definitely say no if you don't want it because they are very pushy. Other than that, this beach is great for the whole family.

Seminyak beach had some wonderful views, and from a distance was picturesque. Upon further inspection, however, there was a rather obnoxious smell that, whilst initially unforthcoming, I found to be more apparent the closer I reached to the water..it was at this point I realized swimming would be a poor choice. Other tourists didn't seem to mind, so if you're adventurous at heart-by all means, have a gander!

I struggle to think of anything nice to say about Seminyak beach but as I hate negative reviews I'll try to be objective;
Pros: Plenty of dining options/beach clubs. Plenty of nearby accommodation.
Cons: Ugly beach - black sand. Far nicer beaches to be found elsewhere in Bali, even Kuta is much prettier. I would not visit again Seminyak Beach again.

What a lovely beach, long and sandy. Safe bathing as long as you take note of the flag colours. Quite awesome surf. Sun set is a fantastic sight from beach. If fit you can walk along the waters edge all the way to Cuta beach.

Clean than Kuta but not as nice as Jimbaran Beach.. Waves are good for surfers, but make swimming dangerous

Not the best beach I've been too but it's OK bit choppy for me, there are toilets on the back of the beach and also food and drink stalls and it's very cheap, women come round the beach selling fresh fruit and cold drinks which is a bonus

The ocean here is special with a kilometer of rolling surf tubes which can feed your soul for hours. Unfortunately the beach sand is filthy and grey water drains directly into the beach so risky to let kids play here.

It's a lovely beach, with a great sunset. Lots of umbrellas and chairs to hire to stay out of the sun, some of the people selling get annoying and a bit of rubbish but still really nice beach

Such a great beach with a range of restaurants and seating to chose from! It's really nice to see that this beach is really well looked after! The sun loungers are a little expensive however if you are staying for the whole day it's well worth getting one with an umbrella too because that sun gets super hot! The sand is so nice and soft and looks like it sparkles! So many people out surfing and lots of places to hire a board for an hour or so!
In the evening lots of beanbags are placed on the beach under really cute umbrellas and lots of lights. Definitely a nice spot to grab a drink and a bite to eat. Would recommend checking this beach out you won't be disappointed!

The beach is great except for the plastic! The beach guys do as much as they can to clear it up after the tides gone out but there's still so much. People should be soley employed to clean the beach and take the rubbish away. Helpful for the environment and it would provide employment.?

With the amount of revenue that Bali is receiving from tourism, it's time for the Indonesian government to step up on the waste problem. The sea around Bali is heavily polluted with plastic. We saw three dead turtles whilst travelling in Indonesia, and were informed that the most common cause of a turtles premature death in those waters in due to ingesting plastic. Seminyak beach is covered in tiny pieces of plastic and polystyrene which ends up in marine life's stomachs. Which is wonderful for the local people who rely on fish for protein. We spoke to many fishermen who are outraged by this horrendous rubbish problem in the ocean. Playing in the waves you feel rubbish brushing past you and it's just not pleasant. One day we didn't even go in the sea as there was so much rubbish!

There needs to be recycling facilities that are readily available and free for hotels in Seminyak and all of Bali. We saw local people raiding bins outside hotels for plastic bottles and cans, surely these could at least be left out for them!?
We couldn't even find anywhere in Seminyak where we could refill our plastic water bottles.

Human waste is also released into the sea all around Bali via the sewer pipes that go down the beach and out to sea.

Also watch the current at Seminyak beach. Great for us surfing and body boarding but we also saw three separate occasions where life guards had to rescue people who had been taken out by the current. Great fun in the big waves but just be careful.

The scene was magic, beautiful ocean & weather, we hired a couple of lazy boys to lay on for the time we were there & the beach was busy.

The beach is quite flat, with little character to it. It is simply filled with hundreds of sunbeds and its hard to find a spot on the beach where you wont hear blaring music! Good for thise who just want to drink in the sun, but not for those who want to relax!

This beach could be great with a little care and attention. There are several beach bars at night where you can enjoy live music, however some of the acts compete to be heard and if sitting in one bar the sound of that bars entertainers can be drowned out by the musicians of the bar next door. Also the beach could do with a bit of a tidy up. Beds charged at 100,000 IDR for two which you can try to negotiate as it works out to be abt ¬£8.00 and you can get a meal for two for that price.

Great Cantina just up from W resort . Cheap drinks and food . The food is also really good . Hire a lounge for 50000 for as long as you like . The beach itself is a little dangerous so be careful . Strong currents can drag you around . A little dirty at low tide . Alot of plastic and other rubbish on the beach . Great for the Bali sunsets as well . Great fun , but be careful in the water.

Seminyak beach is a nice Long clean beach with many restaurants and bars along the beach. You can rent out loungers and umbrellas for a modest cost for the day. The sand is a dark Colour but clean. You will find many locals selling their products along the beach ranging from coconuts to art to kites. In the evening a number of the bars and restaurants put out chairs so you can dine on the beach itself. There is quite a strong current and strong waves at parts of the beach so some care is needed and close supervision of children.

Myself and my girlfriend were expecting a pristine white beach with a couple of cool bars, so we were slightly disappointed. More of a mediterranean style Spanish beach with sometime pretty awful live music at every bar during the night (which is played on individual stages with massive speakers so you can't really have a nice chilled conversation). Not what we expected it to be - if you want a chilled out paradise vibe, Gili Trawangan is an absolute must.

Not the best beaches in the world, Phuket being much much better and not like Boracay with its white sand. I would say it's an ugly beach, but clean and plenty of food along the beach. Also plenty of water activities available, but again not as good as you'd find in Phuket. I don't know why people come to Bali as its overpriced now and even beach side meals in local owned restaurants are around AUD$7-10 a meal, beer about AUD$4-5 a bottle (Phuket equivalent is less than half that). People are nice, and not annoying trying to sell u stuff but not pushy. What it lacks are beach massages like in Phuket, and definitely not as nice. See photos and you'll see what I mean.

Ok so the beach isn't that beautiful. The sand isn't white and the water isn't turquoise like a beach you would find in Australia, however the atmosphere is relaxed, the sunsets are to die for and there are loads of restaurants, bars along the beach, many of which have live music playing and great cocktails. You don't come here for the beauty of the beach as much as you would for the atmosphere. It's lots of fun and worth a visit.

Went a few times to have a drink as the sun went down, was quite nice to see the sun set and listen to some live music. In terms of the actual beach it was very dirty, lots of rubbish. The surf was very choppy and shallow. Don't swim there unless you're a strong swimmer, make sure to swim between the red and yellow flags, there are lifesavers but they don't seem to pay much attention. Certainly wouldn't allow children to swim unless they were very good swimmers. If you are looking for a clean and beautiful beach this is not the place, go down to the southern beaches (around Uluwatu and nusa dewa). But mind you I am Australian so I am used to some very beautiful beaches!

Honestly do not even bother going there! I was appalled when I saw how nasty this beach is. I mean Bali does not have nice beaches at all unless you are a surfer but this one is one of the worst. It just looks like you are at Brighton beach , NYC. The water is black, the sand is black with litter everywhere, the lounge chairs are 100 years old and vendors haggle you for a pedicure or a sarong every 5 minute! I had to leave to go to Kuta beach which is also disgusting. Bali is definitely NOT the place to go if you want turquoise water and white sand beaches!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,230,30>===============  
Kuta Beach much nicer then the one at Seminyak, but much busier. Seminyak is just the beach, where as Kuta has all of the locals set up offering massages, hair braiding, hire a few chairs with some alcohol and watch the sun set.. So if you want to avoid any of that then Seminyak doesn't have any of that.

Stayed 5-7 minute walk from Seminyak beach. Pop in headphones or pretend your asleep to avoid hawkers selling you stuff. Got a nice henna tattoo done there, though :)
Good swimming waves and my hubby tried out surfing and had a good time-although try to shop around as my husband felt the surf instructor he had didn't give sufficient attention for the price. Don't accept a beach chair for more than 50,000 IDR for two people the whole day, so make sure to negotiate and don't be afraid to pass up a place or two, cuz most likely the first place you passed up may welcome you back at the price you initially wanted :)
All around I think it's a nice beach with a nice sunset and decent vibes.
P.S. Try out Sand beach bar & restaurant at night on the beach--decently priced with good live music and is one of the more attentive, service-oriented staff/waiters/waitresses than the other spots nearby.

Came here twice on 2 occasion, You can find bars, restaurants near by. Suntan on the beach, learn surfing, play in the sea, take a walk. At night, usually many bars/restaurants will bring out bean bags on the beach and have live music and its a sight to hear and see.

For surfing, its a very good place for beginners. Price per person for 1h lesson and 1h free surfing $100,000 - $150,000

We still love a beer on the beach, we always sit at Aussies bar it's just fun. We do our souvenir shopping for the kids while we have a beer, massage and buy our fruit.
You have to be prepared to be swarmed by the hawkers and be able to get rid of those you don't want to buy from- my method is be really nice and have fun with them but be up front and let them know right away that you're not interested and if you tell them you are then you should buy it from them and not waste their time arguing over 50 cents. We get the cheapest prices on the beach and the fruit is always fresh and fabulous. It's important to remember this is whats done on the beaches in Bali, you can't be rude to these guys this is just what they do.
Its a fun place to meet other travelers and have a chat, share experiences and make plans.
Always worth a sit down for a icey cold drink . :-)

Joined a large number of locals, ex pats and visitors walking along the clean beach (sadly it has to be cleaned up early morning in the morning because of the significant sea pollution)every morning, especially good at low tide.

Seminyak beach was nice enough. I have been to much better beaches in the past.
It was clean and not to many locals trying to sell you things. There were heaps of restaurants and bars. Plenty of lounges to hire.
It was a pretty calm day when we went but many people were having a go at eater sports anyway.
The water is warm but not very clear. Still great to cool off, after being in the hot sun all day.

Seminyak beach is a long stretch of shoreline of fine black sand. It is not crowded whether one will go there in the morning or afternoon. We went swimming in the morning & the waves is not that intense. A lot of people are jogging, walking & some are even doing yoga on the beach.
In the afternoon we strolled the beach to watch the sunset. It is so nice to see the kaleidoscope of color, the sky merging with the ocean as the shore reflects the colors of the sunset when the water rushes back to the sea...a respite from the crowd of tourists in Bali.

Dont expect nice beaches in this part of Bali. There are people pestering you. You can hire boards, and there are chairs usually to sit on (might have to pay for them). If you do want nice beaches, head to Finn's Beach Club or Uluwatu. Both are beautiful. Finn's is much more commercialised than Uluwatu. It has a restaurant and day beds and trendy, hip music playing, a bar... and is fully set up. You have to pay to get down there (you go down on a little cart, sort of scary). The food is expensive. Uluwatu on the other hand is for surfy people uninterested in all that stuff. To get to the beach you walk down stairs on a cliff (not scary, totally safe). There are traditional Indonesian cafes sticking out of the cliff with really yummy food and an AMAZING view. Plus, you don't have to pay to use the beach. I much prefer Uluwatu, but that's just me.

What a great experience! Go for the sunset, pull up a bean bag, relax & enjoy the music! At each little place the music is great & food incredible value. It's an experience not to be missed if visiting Bali. Very casual & you're sure to find some music to suit your taste. Service great at all of them & the best place to have fun with friends. We will do this every time we go to Bali, highly recommended!

Seminyak is one of the beach that you would like to visit if you prefer a quiet place to admire the waves. It has alot of restaurants along the beach with beanbags for your relaxation.

My friend and I wandered down to the beach after a nice salad lunch. The beach was nice but a bit disappointing, mainly because there is no accommodation made for people like us who are not staying at a waterfront hotel to relax on a lounge chair. Basically, we walked the beach and had to sit on our slippers when we wanted to rest for a bit. Still, there were no vendors harassing us on the beach, which can be a problem at beaches the world over. Also, the views were really nice. We happened to be there during low tide so we actually walked quite far out into the ocean while we were still on dry land. The surf was rough so we didn't swim but the water felt great as we stood in it up to our knees. Will I go back? No, I think I'll enjoy the pool at my hotel instead. The beach wasn't great enough to warrant another visit, especially since we're not surfers - there were a few surfers in the water but not being a surfer myself, I can't give any feedback on that aspect of things. However, I'm happy I can at least say that I checked it out.

I would probably rate this as good but TA doesn't have that rating so...it's not so bad but I'm spoilt with the white sand and clean beaches of Australia.

This is a mixture of black volcanic and white sand beach so gives the impression of not being as clean as it could be but the beach is very long and very wide and friendly enough for your kids to paddle in.

I love this long beach for morning walks and lazing at the bean bag bars to watch the sunset- truly magical. The kids love the beach for it's nighttime entertainment- hawkers selling glow toys, art work, massages, sarongs and the beautiful coloured candle lanterns that are released after sunset.
What I dislike immensely is all the rubbish both washed up and left higher on the sand.
On my 1/2 hour morning walk yesterday I passed copious plastic bags, 2 used disposable nappies, 2 tubes of toothpaste, plastic water bottles etc. It is not a prisptine beach, it has streams of foul water running into it and although they do clean the beach in the mornings it is still polluted. I don't swim there and my kids, who swallow sea water like seals, are not allowed in either- pools are a safer option.

We have been travelling around Bali and had our last days near this beach. It was around Nuepi, Balanese New Year. A religious time where lots of ceremonies are held at the beach. This means a lot of polution, 1000s of palm leaf plates with cigarettes, flowers ect. all over. At the same time the beach it self didnt appeal to anything else but surfing, not swimming. But the beach was nice for walking and watching sun sets.

Had a nice time on the beach. Especially loved how they had restaurants/bars right on the beach with lots of comfortable lounge seating. We saw on big bean bag chairs while we watched the sunset and drank beers. They also had a great live band playing on the beach. The only downfall was the beach merchants. My advice would be to not buy or talk to any of them if you don't want anything. If you buy something from one they will all flock to you. Although it was nice to get a foot rub while watching the sunset :)

Am I missing something here? We are staying in the middle of Seminyak so a trip to the beach was a must do. Went to the Mosaic Beach club (which is quite okay) but very disappointed in the beach and can't recognise what I saw in some of the reviews! Hot, grey, coarse sand, ungroomed beach access points, strong tides (and I can swim well) and sewage outlets so a walk along the beach is an obstacle course. I like lots of things about Bali but give me Aussie beaches anytime, rather than Seminyak, although I will go back to enjoy the Sunset!

I stayed in Seminyak at Dash Hotel and had a wonderful stay there. Seminyak is perfect if you want to party but the beach is not the best one of Bali if you are a swimmer.
Besides, Seminyak as the vibe of little town on the beach like Dauville or St Tropez. This is very pleasant to stroll in small streets for shopping...very nice boutiques and good restaurant & coffee shop.
The location is perfect if you are trendy, like party and can drive a motorbike to explore Bali

There was a large stretch of sand, some of which was black and there was quite a bit of litter flowing in the streams to and from the ocean. Anyone who doesn't notice the pollution at this beach needs to get their eyes checked and reconsider what a good beach looks like. The hawkers also made it somewhat unpleasant, and the entrance/exit is quite tricky to find if you're a first timer. We weren't allowed to walk through any hotels to the main road, so we left with blistered feet from the hot sand trying to find our way out. I would not visit this beach again in a rush. I've seen much better beaches in Bali.

The first day we arrived to Bali our Friend took us to Seminyak beach, the lights and the atmospher were denomination of beauty, music was popping at each corner and it was a nice evening chill area. The next morning we went to Surf as well, and since they we go surfing there Everyday especially since the waves are crashing us

We had a lazy day early on Seminyak beach, doing a bit of eating, reading and tanning then returned in the evening for a few drinks on the beach under lit up umbrellas. This is what I pictured Bali being like. Absolute bliss.

The pictures will illustrate better than my words ever could.

We really like Seminyak Beach. Saw that many persons has written in their reviews that beach is poorly cleaned, but we did not experience that at all. Very clean beach and many nice pool/drink bars along the beach as well.

Regulars to the seminyak area - we stayed at the Oberoi for our Wedding anniversary. Beach is great by bali standards - as always watch out for dogs and their outputs. Surfed 9 days in a row - gold.

We have been staying in Jimbarran but have visited Seminyak and Kuta. We have decided that if we return we would stay in Seminyak. Jimbarran is a little quiet and away from things and Kuta is, well, Kuta. Seminyak is the in between option. Good beach with more sand, large number of restaurants and less hawkers than Kuta while a bit more lively than Jimbarran.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,238,30>===============  
Not a really special beach. Its clean and has alot of beach bars. Not As much vendors As on kuta beach. But still there are Some.

Beach beds cost around 100.000 if you dont bargain. You should at least Get them under 50.000 for a day.

Good luck.

Lots of choice on the beach for live music dinner and drinks. Great value for money. Every evening whilst there we would wonder down for the beautiful sunset to top off our busy days. Lots of choice for meals . Italian, asian and western cuisine.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,238,50>===============  
Seminyak has got to be the busiest and most exciting beach resort destination in Asia! Although no longer a quiet little fishing village (which I expect some people lament) it now has something for everyone, all ages, and surprises everywhere to keep you entertained and on your toes!

Highly recommend grabbing a bean bag on the beach at dusk and trying some of the local cocktails ;) Selfie stick not necessary!

If you are in the area, watching the sunset at a good bar or restaurant is a must. Breath taking beauty. Beach is fairly clean and safe to swim at. Some places about to hire surf and body boards.

No shade, only drawback, unless you hire beach lounge and umbrella, beach hawkers weren't as frequent

Seminyak beach was OK fairly clean and not as crowded as Kuta, unfortunately we found the hawkers on the whole to be pushy and quite rude on the day we visited which is always a disappointment in a destination known for its friendly and happy people, in fairness it is hard to make a positive comment on Balinese beaches in comparison to our beaches at home but overall was not blown away but at the same time not sorry we took the time to have a look.

The beach itself is really poor, sometimes quite dirty and smelly but there are lots of bars crating a nice atmosphere. The only problem is that bars are really close to each other and if sitting outside you can ear loud music from different bars

We went down there on our first night on Bali. The beach itself is fairly clean, considering the amount of people there. It's a nice beach, even with a decent surf break and if you like it a bit more busy with entertainment (bars, etc.) around you definitely a cool beach. Way too busy and loud for us though, so only 3 stars.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,239,20>===============  
The place was covered with rubbish. Enough said i think. So much for a romantic walk if you are tripping over empty bottles. OK it must be the tourists, but it's up to the authorities to tidy up. There are a lot of bars along, nothing special. If you sit on the beach prepare to be nagged every 2min by somebody selling selfie sticks or some dubious paintings.

Did not meet the expectation one bit.

Very nice place to hang out. You can see the sunset here. Around you can find many cafe and good restaurants. So many activities doing by tourists here.

We stayed at Pondok Sara Villas only a 5 minute walk to the beach.The sunsets were fabulous,.All the restaurants had there own bands and bean bags to relax by the beach.. Also only about a 10 minute drive to Kuta. There were lots of small and large eateries, Also if you like corn on the cob they barbeque it on the beach. Really nice and fresh. Would definitely go there again.

This only our 3rd visit to Bali but after trying a few different spots along the stretch of beach from Ku de Ta in Seminyak to Marriot at Legian in our view the beach directly in front of Chez Gado Gado is our favorite.
Water is clear, surf is good for beginners to intermediate, lounge chair hire for a pair is usually $50k per hour and surfboard hire the same.
The old guy selling Bintang, water and soft drinks will run a tab, the ice cream vendor calls past regularly and if you need cheap eats you have a good selection on the beach nearby or alternatively can go more upmarket with Gado Gado.
Contrastingly the Seminyak end near Ku de Ta has poor surf, the water is murky and contains quite a bit of rubbish and the beach vendors charge more saying... 'it is Seminyak'.
If you enjoy the beach and swimming/surfing and have teenagers the Gado Gado area is the spot for you.

Seminyak, like its brother Kuta, allowed us to see the beautiful sunset, laid back cafes, flying kites, and (not fully) good music. I recommend La Plancha as your best place to enjoy Seminyak. As i didn't prefer too dynamic clubs such as Double Six and Cocoon.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,241,40>===============  
Cleaner than Kuta beach and less touts around the place.

Heaps of waterfront restaurant and bars with live music and tables, bean bags, shade options on the beach to see the beautiful Seminyak sunset.

Good nightlife in a more upmarket environment compared to the beaches of Legian and Kuta.

The beach at Seminyak has changed a lot over the last 15 years, as expected. What I did not expect this time around was the huge increase in the volume of garbage on the beach. It was very dissapointing to see so much garbage washing up on the shoreline. It was hard to enjoy a stroll along the beach while dodgeing so much garbage. So sad to see and nobody really seems to care.

Seminyak Beach is OUTSTANDING...!! Lots of great beach bars to watch the sunset, a number of them even have live music. An ideal place to relax and watch the sun go down.

During the day, you can surf and swim - Just one tip - The sand gets REALLY hot... Make sure you take some flip flops..!! (Thongs for your Aussies out there!).

We walked down the beach from Seminyak - Legian - Kuta (About a 35 minute walk). It is in fact the same coast line, but called different resorts. The beach seems to get more dirty as you go along. (More rubbish in the sea and on the sand).

This stretch of beach could be beautiful but it's not. I went back today when it was just off high tide to see if it was any better than when we were there at low tide. But no luck, it is still dirty and polluted. What a shame. The sand when wet resembles mud and sticks like paste to everything (not like most sand, which sticks but will brush off). I know the locals have to make a living but there are so many people trying to sell you things, which is fine when walking through but I imagine it could get a little annoying if you decided to sit in the beach.

I saw and heard many people complaining of skin rashes and sores after the beach and swimming in the ocean.

Hopefully Bali can get a plan together to reduce the water and beach pollution and increase recycling or people will stop coming and that would be a real shame.

It is a beautiful long stretch of beach which needs to be cleaned up.

Not to far away from bustling Kuta, Seminyak is a perfect place to escape from noises. There are a lot of pretty small shops along the streets, polite people, and the weather is not as hot as Kuta. The beach is cleaner compared to Kuta Beach, strong winds and soft sands. There are a lot of stray dogs running around (loving it!). Sunset view is amazing. Very peaceful and calming, at night a lot of bars and live music around.

Many eateries but a bit hard to find Indonesian restaurants here.

My wife and I really enjoy Seminyak Beach. We surf using surfboards, body boards, the property of The Legian Bali Hotel where we stay, and plain surfing and swimming. When the tide goes out the beach is fantastic for long walks on firmer sand.
The ladies who sell beads and sarongs to keep their families housed and fed are all pleasant and beautifully mannered. Kikki, Rosy and Sally also provide massages on the beach, manicures, pedicures to a high standard which we take advantage of to add to the attraction of the beach. They treat us so well we return to the magnificent The Legian Hotel Bali as often as we can. The really good fun is once every stay I get into a bartering discussion buying goods from them. At the conclusion I pay the agreed price and give them back the goods and tell them to sell them to someone else. Their well being is much more important to my wife and I than the goods or the money. They are lovely ladies in happy marriages with a strong sense of family. They add value to the beach in the area that is accessed by the public whether they are visiting the beach or staying at a hotel along the beach. I never cease to be amazed at how these ladies and their children speak perfect English and are so inquisitive about our 5 children, their spouses and our 13 grandchildren. It all adds to the beach that is regularly cleaned and well policed. We will return soon.

This beach could be really beautiful and fine to sunbathing at.

Whether you're looking for water sports, to read a book, go for a swim or walk, Seminyak beach is the place to be.

Lovely white beach stretching on for miles with a warm blue sea to cool off in. Loads of places rent sun beds with parasols cheaply and the edge is lined with many good bars and restaurants.

You do get approached quite a lot by the beach sellers but they are friendly and only trying to earn a living.

A great place to spend long, sunny and relaxing days.

Seminyak Beach is a must when in Bali. This beach must be unique, because in the afternoon it transforms into a beanbag beach.

I first went to Seminyak Beach last year when my wife and I attended a wedding. I could only shoot from the hotel grounds because of lack of time. This time I did some internet research to find out more about this beach, which is just slightly north of Legian and Kuta. I discovered beautiful shots of people having a grand time under giant umbrellas while lying down on giant beanbags. I was determined to shoot the sunset there.

As I was staying at The Magani Hotel in Legian and was carrying a heavy camera bag, I took a taxi to Seminyak Beach. The driver dropped me off near Double 6 Seminyak Hotel. From there I just walked to the beach. Instead of writing about what I saw, just take a look at some of the images I shot. You'd wish you were there.

I think this beach ia better than kuta beach (if you are staying near the city). You can rent chairs for IDR30k-IDR50k. But you cannot have a relaxing sunbath because there are alot of people offering stuff to you. Manicure, pedicure, tattoo, etc.

This beach is beautiful with a no of restaurants and beach side bars. You can rent your loungers for a pretty cheap price and enjoy the waves and the breeze. This beach is excellent for surfers but not that great for swimming bcoz of the strong currents. Perfect place to enjoy the sunset as well.

Husband and I took a stroll on this beach today. The water was warm enough to be considered bath water. The waves were incredible. If I were surfer I would have been stoked, dude. Totally stoked. We also stopped off at Ku De Ta for a slushy (we both got watermelon, but I had to add simple syrup to mine because it was toooo sour). We watched two senior citizens battle the current, only up to their knees in the water. I seriously feared for their lives as I watched them almost get sucked out with the current. I'm pretty sure this isn't a place for swimming on account of those currents and those monster waves, but it sure is pretty. Worth a walk. The only downside is the depressing garbage that washes up with the waves ... plastic bags, bottles, yogurt cups (I had no idea so many peopled liked yogurt), and weird things I couldn't identify. I feel sorry for the fish around Bali.

Seminyak beach it's self is pretty average. We had just stayed at Sanur and Nusa Dua which has white sand beaches and clear blue water, we expected the same of Seminyak. This was absolutely not the case. The beach is littered with rubbish, has run off from the drains which makes the area around the outlets brown and brings in even more rubbish and the sand is black, not white!

The only positives I can conclude are that the sunsets are amazing from Seminyak Beach and there are many hotels which offer day bed hire, but these are very expensive for Bali. The cheapest we found was IDR 500,000 per day bed (which you can use for food and drink) which can fit 4 people comfortably however others had 6ppl at the Potato Beach Club up to IDR 1,000,000 per person at the gorgeous W Retreat.

if you want to spend some extra time out of your hotel in Seminyak then you can reach this beach easily either by a hotel shuttle or through a taxi that wont cost you much. along the beach there are many cafes and bars to chill in or you can just relax on the warm sand. if you have more time and want to see better beaches I suggest you see the Padang Padang Beach as well.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,248,30>===============  
If I have to give some very useful advice, skip Seminyak beach and go straight to Legian or Kuta beach (10 minutes‚Äô walk). It basically looks the same, only difference is that the rental beds, drinks, food etc are half the price there.

We found Legian beach best, since it was not crowded but also affordable.

Average beach , beautifully warm water and fun waves (be careful strong current)
We paid 100K for 2 long chairs (50K each) for the full day

As an avid health nut I jogged down to Seminyak beach at day-break. The beach was alive with people raking and collecting what looked to be an insurmountable amount of plastic articles.
Apparently when the rains set-in, debris flows from neighbouring Java which adds to the problems Bali faces. I couldn't find a rubbish bin anywhere, except 150 meters away near a hotel opening... Obviously this is part of their problem.

Seminyak is a lovely beach, especially for watching the sunset with a few cocktails (at Kudeta). You can also surf or swim. The beach itself is not one of the most beautiful beaches as the sand is quite dark.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,249,50>===============  
One of the coziest beach experience i have ever had. everything was just perfect.
There are a lot of options available with bean bag type couches you can just chill on.

Beer and food are nicely priced and you can just enjoy all that with the view of the sunset plus with live music playing in the background (they accept requests), you can even sing along with the band if you wanted to.

Just say no to the vendors and they won't bother you anymore.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,249,40>===============  
Much more relaxing,peaceful and cleaner compare to Kuta beach, also recommend Legian beach. La plancha beach bar and restaurant is the place to chill during sun set or early nite drinks at Seminyak beach,well there's a few next to it too.

Not the best for swimming although tell that to the many who do. With the wet season the run off from the land is just too high and the rubbish etc is higher than normal. The beaches are being tidied though but sometimes a fell their fighting a loosing battle. They must keep at it though. A walk from Seminyak beach to Discovery Shopping Mall takes about an hour and a half walk. If the tides right and you have a bit of a head breeze it can be a beautiful walk.

People visit Seminyak Beach for the location. The beach itself is decent, but not wow-inducing by any means.

It's crowded, but not as packed as Kuta Beach. And you will still be assaulted by throngs of itinerant salespeople. A brief "makasih, tingal disini" shall suffice.

The surf is quite decent (beginner/intermediary depending on the swell) but beware: the current can be treacherous (way more than in Kuta Beach).

A stunning beach and a beautiful sunset. The bars and hotels that line it were amazing. The only problem is a lot of it was rough and closed so if you fancy a swim you need to be either strong or have a good day.

It is great for a walk or to sunbathe but I had great concerns about water quality. There are a number of outlets from inland, washing all sorts of rubbish into the sea. It was not the rubbish you can see that bothered me however but what you can't see.
I would strongly advise that if you did choose to swim, you not put your head under the water for obvious reasons or swim only in the hotel pools. There were a number of signs on the beach saying dangerous to swim. I was unsure if they meant danger of rips or danger from the effluent going into the sea.

There is garbage and filth everywhere. Also, rivers with raw sewage run right through the beach. I ran here twice or maybe 3 times, and it was just disgusting. If you run far enough to the east, you will eventually get to a nicer color sand. However, near our hotel, this was just nasty.

Lovely beach with fine sand, gentle breeze, and inspiring ocean front. I like this beach better than Kuta beach. It is cleaner, less commericialized, and much less crowded. The hawkers seem gentler too so a person can walk around without too much hassle. That said, there are ample "fine" eateries (fine dining now equals higher priced dining) with outstanding views of the beach and people in the beach. This place is where you can have fine dining for about 10 USD in the Fall/winter of 2015

I loved this beach, the views are breathtaking. Great for surfing, you can rent lounge chairs if you're ok with spending the money. There's places to eat along the beach and watch the sun sets.

We have been to Bali a number of times in Jan/Feb and on every occasion on the Kuta - Seminyak beaches it is the same:nice beach but man what a lot of rubbish. Apparently it all washes in from the sea (plastics mainly) and the authorities (?) do not know how to handle it. Halfhearted attempts are made to clean up every now and again but nowhere near enough. I appreciate it's not an easy problem but with all that money poring in from the tourist industry I'm convinced a lot mre could be done.

We didn't surf at Seminyak beach but walked it a lot. Great for running too. Like any other beach in the area, there are a lot of dogs running around, and they do leave their business in the sand, so mind your feet. What upset me was, westerns who own dogs here also put a blind eye to it. They don't clean after their dogs.

There were quite a few storms out in the sea, so there was a lot of rubbish on the beach which is understandable, and in some areas it is being cleared all the time. However, I saw many people, especially locals just leaving their rubbish on the beach after watching the sunsets, even though the bins were right behind them. A bit upsetting.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,253,50>===============  
We went to the beach around Ku De Ta (enter from KuDeTa passage), recommended to go in the morning around 9 if you bring young kids or baby as the wave can be quite rough in the afternoon and the heat can be too much for them.

You can rent beach chairs (2 chairs+1 umbrella) at IDR 100.000 for 3 hours and have sips of fresh coconuts (idr 30.000).

I would say the beach is clean enough, it's not that you'd get tons of rubbish on ur foot as some reviews saying it's a dirty beach.. ;)

Wide and clean beach along Seminyak. It offers miles of walking and many opportunities for waves to learn surfing. If you go for a walk try to avoid the little ‚Äúrivers‚Äù that flow into the see. The smell reveals that this is not fresh water.

Hard to beat at sunset. The most attractive of the Kuta-Legian-Seminyak strip of beaches.

Although other posts have mentioned rubbish etc, it was clean when we were there (several visits, from 21-27 Jan 2016), although it rained every day. We were at the southern end - apparently the stream in the north near the temple can bring out rubbish after rain.

Negotiate for umbrella lounges on the beach - we paid IDR50,000 for a 2-bed lounge, which is probably expensive, but, hey, for $5 all day, who cares? The same chap who sells you the lounge can also supply you with well-priced cold drinks (coke, beer, coconuts etc).

Note for foreign tourists - you can't sit on the lounges for free 'just for 10 minutes', as we saw several tourists try to do, including a couple of female Australians who wanted to change their toddler's nappy (!). The lounges are rented, it's how those guys make their living - if they let everyone sit on the lounges 'just for 10 minutes', they wouldn't make a rupiah.

There are some sellers trawling the beach, but they're not too pushy, and perhaps not as numerous as in Kuta and Legian.

You can just sit on your towels on the beach for free, but you might get burnt that way.

There are numerous beach shacks south of Jl. Camplung Tanduk, they are cheap and good for burgers, juices and beer.

Surf is good for boogie boarding and body surfing. Gets a bit rough and erratic, with some cross-currents, at the end of low tide, be careful near the breakers at this time.

If you're lucky enough to be from a place with outstanding beaches (e.g. Australia, South Africa, Hawaii, California), you might think this beach is not much. But by world standards it is very pleasant and enjoyable. Recommended.

Yes, there are a fair bit of rubbish laying around, but grab a lounge and relax with a drink. It's just an OK beach.

I have to concur with some of the others who have reviewed this beach, in particular Leylandbros who reviewed only yesterday.
I walked from my hotel this afternoon looking forward to a nice walk on the beach following a lovely few days in Ubud. My initial impression was ugh, but I proceeded to walk hoping things would get better.
In the end my partner and I were so disgusted by the amount of rubbish on the sand that we had to leave, vowing never to set foot on this beach again.
I was horrified by the beaches of Sihanoukville but this is the Wes Craven version of horror! :-(

It is rare for me to be so horrified and critical but my walk down the beach on the 4th of February, 2016, was shocking. Due to heavy rain the previous day, a huge amount of rubbish and waste had been flushed out into the waters of the beach. There were signs up saying that swimming was not permitted - due to the high levels of Coliforms in the water. Several of the Hotels were attempting to clean up some of the rubbish on the section of the beach. It seemed like a losing battle. It is so sad for the people of Bali that this happens on a regular basis.

The beach is filthy. Plastic bottles, cigarette buds and plastic bags every were. The lounge chairs are overpriced. The locals try to get somewhere between 50.000-200.000 IR.
souvenir sellers bother you every five minutes and the restaurants and bars play loud music all day. Not much of the Balinese magic there.
It's great for surfers. And I enjoyed a day in the sun on my Bintang towel in the sand. Was very happy to catch some rays after 4 days of rain and no sun.

A nice sandy beach that's not too crowded, we reached the place at about 8, most of the crowd from sunset watching would have left. Nothing much to rave about, the seafood wasn't as cheap as acclaimed, neither was it good.

The only saving grace was the corn, a man with his push cart peddling his corn with his kerosene lamp. That was the best corn I had, the ones in Kuta just didn't make the mark.

Be sure to grab one when you're there!

Went on an overcast day so that didn't help sell it to me but over all this beach is fine but a bit dirty (rubbish). Plenty of medium sized surf (if that's what your into). Heaps of beachside bars with sofa beds / bean bags for you to crash out. Overall it's ok.

This is a nice beach with lots of sand and numerous local vendors looking to make a quick buck. You can buy beer, soda and chips. You can rent an umbrella/cabana. Numerous surfboard rentals.

We liked this beach especially after seeing Kuta Beach which was very dirty . the beach is large so the closer you are to Legian it gets a little dirty and busy but if you are Closer to Petingenget is quite and very nice . Also you don't have a million sellers following you . there are better beaches in Bali but it was a good experience .

Good restaurants/ bars along the beach, great for sunset. Like most southern beaches in Bali more rubbish than you would expect, and at night they open water from the city into the sea, from the smell as it goes in I will never swim here again! Further north a little cleaner I think, but still got sick after swallowing too much water failing at learning to surf. Slightly less crowded than Kuta, more than Berawa.

Seminyak doesn't have the nicest beaches. Nusa Dua (although a fair distance away) is where i would recommend if you'd like to go swimming in crystal clear blue water and bake on golden sand. Seminyak beach has choppy waves (similar to the gold coast) and is overall not as pleasant.

This was the beach where my partner proposed to me (in a quieter area with no hagglers) was beautiful! Almost no rubbish compared to Kuta which was covered in rubbish. We hired beach chairs for 50,000 IDR (around $5 AUS) for 2 hours and beers were around $2.50 each for a Bintang aswell so made the day nice and relaxing. Prepare to get hassled by people selling stuff but just say no or ignore them and continue relaxing.

Great beach to visit in the rainy season. Kuta & legion beaches were full of rubbish from the weather. however it seemed to be a lot less in Seminyak and also beach restaurants had bean bag settings in the afternoon which was cool.

Seminyak is a great place for surfing, chill out at the bars with live music performance. Plenty of bars around there. You can buy a drink at the restaurant and get a shaded umbrella instead of renting sun bed. Surfing board can be rented at rp 40000 an hour. Instructor will cost rp 50000 an hour.

I went here just want to see the famous Seminyak Beach. I came before noon, unfortunately there were not so many people there. I think it must be crowded in the afternoon when peoples want to see the sunset at the beach.
Around the beach you can find luxury hotels and restaurants.

The Seminyak beach is a really nice beach. But with all the people there, it's hard to really enjoy the calm or the ocean. There is also several people trying to sell stuff all the way and everywhere. Not the kind of beach to relax. Good place to enjoy a drink or beer. In february, the ocean is hard to swim at this place.

We went on 5 different beaches in Bali, but liked this one. Water is very clean also the beach is kept clean. It is not crowded and you can enjoy the sun in peace. Ignore all the sellers by just saying "thank you" and they will not disturb you more. Nearby is a lot fof restaurants and coffee shops, also taxis.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,257,20>===============  
There is no real direction to the beach in seminyak. One end is carpark and the other is through the hotels and resorts. There is no board walk as such. If your staying in one of the hotels on the beach that would be fine.

Walked five minutes down the road from our hotel to Seminyak beach and what a disappointment!! Black sand, stray dogs sleeping under chairs, rubbish and hawkers selling their wares. Only upside was the water was warm. Preferred to stay at our hotels man made beach

We walked from Kuta to Seminyak via Legian, it was quite long walk but worth it! Very crowded places but the sceneries were unique and beautiful! Night walk on the beach was very pleasant with lights from resorts and sounds of wave although it was rainy.

We arrived here walking up the path at sunset. Having come from ubud it was surreal dripping into the beach party that was going on but we didn't hesitate! Drinks and apps at la plancha were great. Fun friendly people to talk to not.

Next morning came down again and walked about a mile checking out the waves. The water is so warm it's like a bathtub. There are several surf schools including a Riptide school that looked fun. Cost approx $60-$85usd.

Disappointing amount of litter washed up along the beach. The restaurants nearer us like la plancha clear it away. I think the restaurants and resorts should all pitch in the clean up the beach. Good for business and for the environment.

Hawkers were there but pleasant and didn't keep pushing after you say no unlike what we experienced in ubud.

This is my local beach. At the Petitenget Temple car park. Beautiful LA Lucciola is here for Italian dining.
The resorts on the beach work hard to keep the beach clean but after a rain, it can be daunting. I find around May/June that I can't walk along the beach because of high tides that make the sand very steep and soft

We stayed at an amazing hotel on Seminyak Beach - I have no complaints and would return in a heartbeat- that being said the beach is quite dirty with dog poo and other litter being brought in from the ocean. Maybe if the tides were different, the beaches would be a bit cleaner. I did love how many people walked early in the morning and watched the sun set in the evening, such a wonderful community.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,258,40>===============  
Great beach to walk along and just take in the view, especially the sunset. Parts of the beach are cleaned regularly but a lot of debris builds up after a storm. Offerings are placed on the beach near the river from Seminyak. Take notice of the lifeguard flags on the beach because the tides can be very strong. Bella located near the Breeze sells good sarongs but bargaining is required.

As we walked along one morning from our hotel we sad to see how many plastic bags and dead fish were found on the beach! It's a disgrace to be frank and local governments need to take action. The waters are warm and overall the beach is nice and great for a stroll, but I was so sad to see these poor fish and even an old turtle that had washed up along with plastic bags.
The local hotels have a great location on the beach and a real asset in the beach that needs much love and care!

The beach is not like a white sand pacific beach, personally I didn't like it and opted to swim at our villas pool.

A lot of the beach was closed off to swimmers due to rips, remember to swim between the flags.

There were also lots of flies and hawkers!

The beach is impressive. It's not white sand and crystal water by its clean and there are plenty of loungers and a good price.

The guys that run the loungers have a good selection of drinks and hire body boards at a very reasonable price. There are some good bars along the beach apparently but we didn't make it that far. We did eat in a restaurant just off the beach which was very good.

Definitely worth a look for a swim to cool down from the intense heat and fun if you like waves.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,259,50>===============  
Great night out spent by the beach, relaxing on the provided bean bags listening to live music in the background until sunset then into the night. A selection of eateries to choose from whilst on the beach, from local food to pub style food.
Couldn't ask for a better night..

I love coming down to Seminyak beach at any time of day. It's beautiful to walk or swim first thing in the morning before breakfast when the beach is super quiet. It's great to spend the day here and have lunch at the warungs

This beach is clean compared to most of the other beaches in bali. I've been traveling to bali for thirty years and the water is getting clogged with rubbish!! For some reason Seminyak beach is free of rubbish. The beach it self is great, I've always been able to get a fun wave here and generally to my self. Overall it's a great beach for everyone!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,260,50>===============  
The water is warm and the sand burns your feet so make sure you wear thongs. Seminyak Beach is a great swimming beach for the young and old and the odd Bali dog that came's down to cool off due to the heat and humidity(I'm sure 1 dog I was watching was trying to body surf). My son hired a surfboard for 2 weeks which cost him $10.00 a day and my 14 year old daughter tried her hand at surfing a longboard for $5.00 an hour. The hawkers can be a tad annoying, wanting you to buy more sarongs, elephant trinkets, glasses and watches, but if they don't ask you once they will ask you 100 times. There are some great bars and restaurants along the beach too that have great food and acoustic bands to listen too and the Sunset is just perfect.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,260,50>===============  
Title says it all, little more upscale with a string of beach front restaurants, many of which offer live nightly music. Great place to watch the sunset or the night fishers. Fewer hawkers than kuta but they're all present.

You don't go to Seminyak for the beach. You go for the upscale restaurants and shopping. Which are amazing. The beach has a few nice clubs on it for sunset watching, but in terms of pretty, don't expect much.

It was a nice beach to look over from the hotel pool, or walk up late evening to see sunset, but too many people trying to sell crap made us avoid it for the most part. Also its quite dirty from the storm water from streets, I wouldnt swim there. The beers in the bean bags at night are nice though!

I have to admit I didn't like it when all the bar/restaurants starting opening along this stretch of the beach. But now it seems to be a great place to drop by as the sun sets, stroll along with a bit of low key haggling if you are badly in need of a carved coconut shell, a genuine $5 rolex or a $2 pair of sunnies that your being asked $20 for.

Then after your stroll hop on a bean bag and drink the amber liquid.

Really pleasant way to end the day.

Oh, and I think the very best way to start the day is a vigorous walk, get the heart rate up a little, then do a few sprints up the dunes to really get the blood moving. Drop down and do a push up or a plank. Do any of the above. But make sure to take in the crisp curling waves drumming out the beat for a brand new Bali day.

Went here for a day whilst travelling with friends in August 2015. It was a nice day at the beach, not too busy and not too many people pestering us to buy things so we could relax. It was quite clean too. The area we sat in didn't have many places nearby to buy food and drinks from but I'm pretty sure there was lots further down. I don't surf but there were lots of people surfing and the waves looked pretty good for it. Definitely worth a visit.

Very chilled. Dark coloured sand due to it being a volcanic island. Indian Ocean so lots of big waves!

Beach was clean when we were there. Sunsets were beautiful, and having dinner on the sand at the local restaurant was pretty awesome.

Make sure you negotiate a price to rent the deck chairs. There can be a difference between the vendors. That said, for a few bucks, to have someone bringing you down drinks all day is quite relaxing. Especially when a nice ocean breeze comes on.

The biggest problem (as with all beaches in Bali) are the vendors that hassle you continuously to buy their products. Mind you, my wife wasn't complaining while getting a foot massage.

Coming from Western Australia, nothing beats our sunset. Most of the time we were there it was cloudy so not much of a sunset to wow us. Too busy and those beach side bars play really loud music.

We're from Perth so not quite the white sandy beaches we have at home still get gorgeous sunsets. Gets really busy with bikes and cars walking to the beach. Walking on the sand seemed safe enough only your feet do get pretty dirty. They clean the beach in the morning I think. Although we only ever went in the evening wasn't too bad aside from New Years Day night. I personally wouldn't swim there as I'm freaked out by the black sand and not being able to see the bottom, but there were quite a few swimmers and surfers. It's pretty cool to sit in one of the many bars on bean bags where you still get a great view without sitting right on the black sand.

Seminyak beach is filthy and so is the water. The idea of swimming or relaxing here is unthinkable. It should be cleaned up. It would be a simple matter to organise a Clean up Seminyak Beach event, and I read in one of the local What's On magazines that there is such an event. If it exists, it's not working. Littering should be penalised, as there is litter everywhere.

The beach is crowded, but it's still beautiful. Loads of hotels where you can pop in and out of the loo / to grab a drink if needed.

Rented two deck chairs + a body board for 150k for around 4-5 hours to the far right of Ku De Tah, which was decent enough, though you could probably get it lower if you tried harder.

Sunset is wonderful from here - an absolute stunner. Just make sure you get a close seat to the sea unless you want people in your pictures :)

Its Bali, the beach offers all you could want in terms of sunning, walking, swimming, surfing, happy hour options, etc. We spent a lot of time there, and no complaints....but, was disappointed that so few of the private/public beaches were routinely cleaned after the days high tides. Surrounded by all this greatness but you walk along a lot of trash and have things brushing up on your leg as you wade in the water. No reason/excuse for this given the availability of cheap labor, equipment that can clean large areas quickly, etc. Only real negative of our entire visit.

Seminyak offers a fabulous flat sandy beach that most days is overrun with visitors. Like many other tropical beaches this one has its share of trash that you have to step around : plastic bags and bottles, discarded food containers, bits of clothing.

So much money is made by the local businesses you would think that they would spend a little to clean up the treasure that nature has provided.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,265,50>===============  
A fabulous beach to walk along and visit iconic Seminyak eateries such as KU DE TAH, Potato Head, W Hotel and more. The waters are quite rough, so swim at your own risk- some areas are patrolled; there are many surfers too. There can be a lot of rubbish when there has been a storm. A great beach walk!!

I went a couple of times to the beach but didn't get in the water, big waves mostly for surfers.
Sand dirty, it seems tractors are not used everyday to clean the rubish. Lots of sun shades and sunbathing stretchers for 3 AUD but you need to bargain otherwise you'll be paying 20 in AUD .
Crowded in this time if the year.
New year at the beach watching the fireworks was fine.
Some good restaurants others not good at all.
Smells like sweage in some areas.
Anyway just average.

It is a great beach but just like all beaches are. Mornings are great and so are the evenings with fantastic colors in the sky; and an awesome sunset. What makes it interesting is the party scene in the evenings during sunset. The beach is relatively clean. At various places there are small hut-like restaurants that offer chairs and towels for rent - about IDR 50k for an hour. Drinks like Bintang usually cost about IDR 25k. At some places, the beach is cleaner as it is in front of an expensive resort like ku-de-ta or potato head and the likes.

The party scene lights up during evenings with colorful bean bags all over the place, colorful people on it and the colorful sky ... all making the place really colorful. The place is like a music fest of sorts in the evenings. Wonderful to be here during that time. Mornings are serene and great for a run. Sun rises from the other side and hence the coolness is longer in the mornings making it ideal for a run.

In short, OK beach, not the best in the world. Great for partying and overall feel.

Wouldn't come to this beach other than to watch the sunset. Water warm but the beach was quite dirty. Rubbish everywhere. I guess blame it on the people rather than the beach. Even saw a syringe :( the sunset was amazing though. Pull up a beanbag at one of the beach bars with a drink and just enjoy.

When dreaming of Bali we anticipated lazy days of the beach, which is where we headed out first thing when we arrived.
We were so disappointed with the trash all over the beach, the swimming prohibition flags, and lack of any good place to lay out and make a good beach day possible. After less than an hour by the ocean we reevaluated our priorities and planned to spend the rest of our stay visiting the cultural sights instead.

Our son did some surfing here with one of the locals. He is quite competent but needed someone to help with the local conditions. Would suit a beginner though. Importantly, there's a flagged and patrolled area outside the Oberoi Hotel for swimming where the undertow is a little less than elsewhere. There is some litter on the beach (but they clean outside the larger hotels incl the Oberoi) so those spots are cleaner and remember the sand is dark - but don't be put off. It's also great for a morning or afternoon walk. Hawkers are few and far between and the few that are there are not pushy.

Seminyak beach was bit let down. Nice beach but could be cleaner. Though it was buzzing with nightlife and activitities and it was enjoyable to soak in the atmosphere. The sea was beautiful but you have to watch when you walk for waste on the beach.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,267,20>===============  
Some of our first days in Bali and decided to take a walk to the nearest beach from our hotel, eventually made our way through several streets into the beach but not before having our bags checked by police, that was something quite bizarre until my partner explained to me that Bali has changed quite a lot since the terrorist attacks in 2002 and 2005.

In any case, walked into the beach just to notice a sea of rubbish being washed ashore. Told my missus I wanted to take a swim but as I was getting closer four plastic bags discouraged my attempt to which we started to walk along the beach. If you happen to walk close to any hotel/pub/bar you will see a little more variation on the type of rubbish, ranging from bottles and smoke buds to condoms (I was lucky enough to just find the aluminium packaging.)

Getting close to The Oberoi hotel (or whatever it was) no less than 6 people were laying on the beach under clear influence of way too much booze, two of them screaming obscenities to people walking around. Another couple under a similar situation minus the obscenities after that hotel and a lot more towards the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa... we arrived at the beach around 4:30pm so all this probably happened between 4:30pm to 6pm?

We end up going back to the hotel and crashing by the pool.

I got no idea if Bali has become some kind of tourism dumpster in which people comes here to release any kind of inhibition while locals consent any behaviour in exchange of a constant stream of money from their wallets... at least in Seminyak.

The waves are very strong in Seminyak and hence time in the ocean would be limited. However the view of the strong waves lashing Seminyak is one of the best in Bali and that in itself demands a visit.

My family chose Seminyak beach as our main overnight place during our trip to Indonesia according to my friends' recommendation. The choice was right absolutely. The beach was clean, wide sandy beach with diversified services and beach entertaiment that we enjoyed. Stayed in W retreat resort by the beach front and we were really happy. The beach has not much tourists as other beaches in SE Asia we've stayed.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,267,10>===============  
I'm sure most travellers to Bali must be shocked at the current state of the main beaches.

Both Seminyak and Legian beaches were covered with trash, both in and out of the water - so much so that we avoided these beaches.

The exception is the space in front of some of the major hotels, presumably they employ people to clean them.

Hard to fathom why the local authorities haven't addressed this issue, it is a major blight on Bali.

Would recommend heading out to Batu Bolong for your beach / surf fix, it is almost pristine.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,268,50>===============  
We stayed at a hotel overlooking Seminyak beach and loved it!!

There were enough waves for some amateur surfing and body boarding but not too big to stop any kids from being able to play in the water.

Long beautiful beach stretch also made it great for a morning run.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,268,30>===============  
Out of Kuta, Legian and Seminyak; Seminyak is the one with access to high-end beach clubs and hotels. However, Legian is better situated, waves are both for surfing and playing in water. There are more beach side warrungs and more sunbeds. Seminyak isn't bad either as long as you are chilling at one of the beach clubs.

A nice beach lined with lots of wonderful bars and restaurants. Be careful when walking on the 'promenade' as bikes happily rush past you. Littering does appear to be a slight problem however the view does compensate for this. Visit if you are close by, but save the travel from elsewhere.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,268,20>===============  
If you're travelling from another Bali just to visit this beach, then it's not worth it. Kuta Beach would be better. Lots of trash on Seminyak Beach and it's not really swim-able either.

Hired some comfortable beach chairs, slathered on some factor 30 and spent a beautiful day on Seminyak beach. It's not a great beach for swimming, but the water is pleasant for a quick dip.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,268,20>===============  
This beach is ruined by the huge amount of rubbish on the shore. It makes it completely unappealing for swimming. This is something that needs to be addressed on a major scale. With no central rubbish collection, locals throw items into rivers and it ultimately washes up on Seminyak (and other) beaches. My view is probably marred by the pristine Australian beaches i'm used to, but I'd avoid this spot. it was really pretty gross.

I like seminyak beach better than kuta beach. Better view to watch sunset and not messy. In the context of messy crowd (beach boys with their rental boards and selling beers). Not white sand though. Written by : aventuracognitio.wordpress.com

I like this beach not just because it's extremely central and accessible, but because it has character and life. Compared with the overly commercial Kuta Beach, it has a better vibe. Even though there are many hotels, resorts, beach clubs, along the stretch of beach, especially from the Double Six to the Dhyana Pura areas, the beach still offers a waterside stretch that's great for photo taking, watching dogs (and horses) frollick in the sand, flying kites, or just strolling along the water's edge.

Sunset is of course the favourite time of the day to lounge on one of the beanbag chairs provided by the beach clubs.

Hubbi and I knew we can't lounge for long at the beach...so we only wanted the beach chairs and umbrellas for a couple of hours and we were upfront about the short stay...still, we probably discussed with six different vendors and everyone of them was charging USD10 or more for the few hours we wanted to stay, crazy!!!
We ended up sitting at one and got our price down to USD 8 per chair...for a bit over 2 hours we stayed :(
Bali is so over-rated with tourists, it's often frustrating for travelers.

Seminyak Beach is nice, however it does not live up to the standards of beaches back in Australia. I come from a part of Australia with beautiful white sand any clean beaches, therefore it is hard to enjoy anywhere that's not like that. The sand looks a dirty colour, and there can be a lot of rubbish on the beach. On the plus side, the water is a beautiful temperature and you can get some nice surfing waves (although it is definitely a beach that your have to swim between the flags)
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,270,30>===============  
Nice beach for afternoon drinks or food. Definitely not the golden sands of our Australian beaches, but great for a refreshing dip with the added character of beach bars. The street hawkers are there but very polite and no hard sell. Beautiful sunsets.

Good clean beach with good surf on the doorstep of Seminyak. Tasty bars and cafe which supply beanbags if you buy a drink or food. Hawkers are good natured and no too aggressive ( just be polite, they're trying to make a living too) easy to hire surf or bogey boards and rips are ok. Clean water unlike Kuta.

Nice beach, lots of different bars and places to eat all the way along. Very good surf if that's your thing. Big waves a lot of the time. Can become pretty annoying getting pestered by the locals all the time. They are always trying to sell you stuff. Also if you want to lie on a sunbed you have to pay. But don't be afraid to haggle, there are so many people trying to get you on their sunbed so if they say a price that's too high then just go to the next man. Once you do have a sunbed then the guys running it are happy to bring you beers or whatever you want really.

I was surprised that this beach was fairly clean. At first glance I thought OMG it looks like Patong Beach in Phuket Thailand, but boy was I wrong. The beach was fairly clean, but because the sand was not white at first the water seemed dirty but when you get in you can see your feet from 5 feet in the water. We enjoyed swimming in the cool refreshing water and getting drinks from the beach bars that litter the beach.

Seminyak beach unlike Other nearby beaches have beds for hire most of the way down the beach which you can hire by the hour,most people come down around lunch time where you can have a nice meal at the beach bars.After a drink or meal you can lie on beds until sun goes down by which time more people arrive to watch this lovely spectacle ,this is a truly amazing sight.After sun disappears (6-30-7-00pm November,) people retreat to the bean bags set up on the sand outside the bars.The staff set up a makeshift stage and a band starts playing on the beach,you just lay back and soak in the atmosphere,brilliant.

We visited Seminyak beach on a number of occasions over 12 days. We took our children who are 7, 5 and 3 years old respectively.

Great place for familes. The surf can get rough but safe-to-swim areas are flagged. The surf is great for learning how to body surf which our older children did.

A really friendly place, we met lots of other families by the beach and it was easy to strike up conversations.

We had a sunset dinner one night. Yes, it was expensive but it was entirely worth it to watch the sunset, drink in hand, delicious food close by, lounging on a bean bag. Loved it and the so did the kids.

The water is warm. The kids adored swimming until it was dark.

The sellers can be a bit full on. If you make eye-contact, watch out! Generally though once we said 'no thanks' we were left in peace.

A must-see if you are in Bali. The restaurants along this beach are cheap and delicious, incredibly talented singers woo you as the sun goes down. Sipping on cocktails under brightly coloured umbrellas and fairy-lights is just perfect!

Average beach; don't expect white sandy blue beach... Limited activities, only surfing, not allowed to swim there due to the waves... Walking a distance and you can see sewer-like water flowing towards the beach from the resorts. EWWW...

On a side note, definitely nice for a sunrise/sunset stroll, but that's just about it.

This beach is clean, surfers seem to like this area. Food and surfing lessons are available. At sunset it is the place to go, sit on the beanbags, listen to music, have a cocktail and watch the sunset.

Our third (and last) week at Seminyak Beach.

Concluding: the beach is wonderful; but the (beach)restaurants here serve abstemious/average food; and certainly not cheap!
But: you're on the beach: the sound of the waves, and so on.....that compensates a lot, you expect (and hope).

But no: each beachrestaurant has its own stage with a very loud band playing.
And of course you can discuss about music taste; but you cannot discuss about the volume of the music: you can hardly talk when they are playing

Every restaurant feels the urge to leave (like a dog) a smellflag.

Our conclusion: spend your day at Seminyak Beach and for dinner: find a restaurant near Seminyak Square: several restaurants serve very good food (find them at TripAdvisor!!!). The price is often more than right and the music never dominates the atmosphere

Spent half a day lazing around the beach with the occasional dip in the water. Peaceful atmosphere and saw several local smiles. Would highly recommend coming here.

This was the best among all the beaches I have seen in Bali. One of the most beautiful places to be at sunset. Highly recommend to visit at sunrise or sunset. Many clubs and restaurants along the beach. Most of the people leave the beach after sunset. Went there at 8 at night and saw the beach empty.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,276,40>===============  
large, spread out beaches makes it great for sunbathing (if not interrupted by the locals)..
it is a glistening beach with darkish sand and not so crystal clear water. The waves roll and roll and it is pretty dangerous for new swimmers.
Everything is ridiculously over priced and can be bargained down to 90%.

There are lots of families with young kids and cute dogs running around on leashes which makes it a nice, friendly beach.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,276,50>===============  
Though the beach gets slightly more crowded at sunset the water is shallow and you can just walk right in and swim for quite a distance. It is better than the kuta beach as there are less surfers and this beach is more about swimming and relaxing.

I was shocked there were so few people on this stretch of beach! Everyone seemed to crowd down around Kuta, but up in Seminyak we had so much room to ourselves.

Better one. Better than Kuta and Legian. Seminyak is the house to many luxury and top end hotels and restaurants, I heard people swear by the night life. We found the beach bit cleaner than the other 2 Kuta and Liegian and this was one fantastic part around. Loved the roadside pubs and bars on the other side, surely a tourists paradise.

Nice beach beach, with flag indicators from the many beach front hotel for surfing. Typical powerful wave good for surfing, not for swimmers. Facing west, thus can see nice sunsets in the evening, and on the other side, it is decorated with all lightings from beach restaurants.

Many locals selling goods or surfing lesson etc, very much overpriced, and can usually reduced by half when you walk away. So the price requested is not tally with product or quality.

There are some section of the beach which are public, others are sorted with bean bags and sun bed for rent belong to some operators, you just need to pick any one you like, and they will approach with price.

Many restaurants, colorfully decorated along the beach road, only very few bicycle riders, and the rental is much more expensive than Sanur beach. Sanur beach is equally nice, and much more quite. Seller there also quotes more sensible price for goods.

This beach remains too crowded, and is a dirty one compared to other beaches in Bali. Hence it is good only to view the lovely view of the sunset.There are a lot of people playing volleyball on the beach, some budding sand artists, lots of hawkers and a number of options to eat and drink. This place is good for water sports.

You must go and watch the sunsets. If on a budget sit on the plastic chairs v the beanbags and umbrellas

We hired two over-priced sunbeds and proceeded to play in the waves with the kids. Once the hawkers walking our piece of beach had tried a couple of times, and been rebuffed, we could actually settle in, relax and enjoy ourselves. Lots of cigarette butts on the beach but otherwise it seemed fairly clean and it made a nice change from our hotel pool.

The beach itself was ok at the waters edge. There were some dirty drains and small creeks flowing onto the Beach at various points carrying rubbish with them which takes away from the experience. It was nice to be able to sit at a bar or restaurant along the back of the beach and enjoy a cold drink or meal at sunset.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,277,30>===============  
I've been told Seminyak is way more quiet than Kuta. The beach has got another vibe, with a lot of colorful beach bars, but it's still quite busy. Prices are the same as in Kuta. Lovely place to hang out and watch the sunset, solo or with whoever you want .

Very next to the 'W' and many other hotels (including Legian Bali) along its length. We enjoyed the pleasant walk along the beach. If you find a hotel along this beach, the sunsets will be enjoyable and likely to be visible from your ocean view room itself - but on the beach it will be much more fun...

Not a bad beach, not bad surf, but there are loads of beaches in the world like that. Nice sunsets, but hawkers abound! Do not buy anything here - VERY overpriced, no matter what you haggle down to. Go to Ubud or beyond for that. Nice place to get some food or a drink, but is priced accordingly.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,277,30>===============  
Stayed on the beach to enjoy the sunset with some juice and simple snacks. Juice was rich in taste, not too sweet. The 3 bnacks a little boring. The view was beautiful and I think that is what you pay for.

An afternoon in Bali is not complete without a relaxing drink on the beach.

Seminyak beach has a number of warungs Resto and bars along the beach between double six and Jl Arjuna.

Be prepared to be assaulted by the beach vendors plying there wares. But they are respectful if you just say no.

so be it a Bintang or a cocktail the sunset is best viewed from a comfy beanbag chair on the sand above the high water mark

Enjoy !!

As stated above, this is the longest and widest beach I've been to - but what I've mostly liked is the myriad of restaurants and bars along the Seminyak-Legian section of the beach - some to recommend, such as Champlung, with great after-sunset live music :-)

This is a beautiful beach, which is kept clean and not too crowded. Watching the sunset from the beach was beautiful, and the restaurants along the beach front set-up lounging areas and some even have live music so you can enjoy the beach in the evenings.

I spent an afternoon at Seminyak Beach body surfing and it was so much fun. The waves are big but it didn't feel dangerous. No undertow. There were a few surfers in the evening but they mainly came out the next morning. Very nice long beach for walking. Great spot to watch the sunset.

Lovely beach with beautiful sand and lovely clear waters. I visited this beach in October 2015 and every day was sunny with lots of people around-not too busy however! Beach loungers are not too expensive we paid 100,000 rupiahs for 2 beds. There are a few sales people selling various knick-knacks but not as much hassle as some other places I have been to. This is a long stretch of beach that connects to Kuta beach. Would definitely recommend this beach if youre staying in seminyak!

Depending on the time of your visit, this place offers varying experiences. It is very clean most of the months but during the winter months, the tide brings back all the plastic waste on the beach.

Seminyak beach has less hustle and bushel then Kuta. Same black volcanic sand but a bit more rubbish as there are not so many Hotel, so less cleaning done. Dirty creeks run straight in to the sea, so i did not bother to have a swim. It's good for a cheap sun set, if you don't mind no bands playing and you bring your own drinks.

Thoroughly recommend a lazy afternoon and evening whiling away the time slouched on a beanbag at one of Seminyak beach bars. Any will do, they're all the same pretty much - just choose the one with tunes you can tolerate and plonk yourself down. The service is efficient and friendly, the food comforting and delicious, and the Bintang washes it down smoothly. What more could you ask? Oh, and then there's those sunsets...magic.

Walking distance frm Seminyak Square. But we unsure of the exact shortcuts to the beach. So we had our long way walk till we found Ku De Ta restaurant, But we didnt enter from here as there is security check to enter the restaurant. So we just walk ahead and found ourself nearly at the end before reaching to 'Legian Bali' . So we guessed that we have made the wrong moves by not always asking for direction. Choices of turn right or left facing beach . We decided to turn left and walk few miles before reaching seminyak beach (this time round, we made e right choice.)

Seminyak beach , full of tourist and lots of restaurant, noisy but really njoyed, surfers, eyecathing on horse riding pass u and there will be people approaching to u that can make hair braiding. Nicely doNe!!

We end our day there by ordering cocktail and walk back to Ku De Ta restaurant and ask the security if we can exit here. He smile and say yes..

Right beside it's sister beach at legain, Seminyak is the less crowded of the two. However, they are both pretty similar in terms of what they have to offer. Surf and drink vendors line the beach offering surf lessons and board rental. Salesmen of sunglasses and henna artists will also offer their wares and services to you.

If you love to surf, the place here is pretty great. However, be warned that they can be quite strong for a beginner surfer, so don't go too far out! In fact, if you are a beginner, it might be better to surf at Legain. Also, there are more surfers in Legain so it would be easier for anyone to spot you if you're in trouble.

*In fact I had to be saved by a lifeguard after getting swept out by a riptide!

We read that beaches in Bali are nothing to rave about so didn't have a high expectation. Actually Seminyak beach as well the adjoining beaches exceeded our expectations.

We stayed at the Oberoi, which is located on Seminyak beach. Everyday, we walked either north towards the W hotel or south towards the airport for 2-3 hours. For the most part, the beach has fine white sand and is clean and empty. There are quite a few "natural" waterways draining into the ocean on the beach. Our hotel claims it's from the rice fields, but these waterways smelled awfully like sewer. In between the luxury hotels, there would be the odd house with a garbage dump right on the beach. The southern end of the beach is a bit rowdy and touristy but has better sand. If you go in the morning before the partiers wake up, then it's serene and romantic. Sunsets are gorgeous!

We visited this beach a number of times during our stay in Bali. During the day the beach is covered with lounge chairs and umbrellas to hire (we were quoted $20 for an hour) as well as people selling just about everything. In the evening, the lounges are mostly away, the bars open up and the people flock to see the sunset.

The beach is wide and the water is cool and refreshing. It is relatively clean and there is plenty of space for everyone.

It's the Australians version of the Brits spain. HOWEVER, the beach is all but spotless. They charge sooo much (for Asia) for beds but they're some of the comfiest beds we've had in a year of beaches in Asia. By the end of the day the sea ia so far out and the waves were so big we gave up but that's because were lazy.
Looked great for surfing.

Ok, so you will have to pay somewhere between AUD$15-25 for 2 sun lounges on the beach for 1/2 to a whole day, about AUD$10 for a good sarong, massage, kites, sunglasses etc, and yes you will get hassled by the local entrepreneurs to buy from them.

This is their island.
This is how they make money to live, pay the bills and put food on the table.

Have fun. Be friendly, and make an attempt to speak at lest 2-3 words in their language.
If you are rude and disrespectful, the you deserve the same in response.

We had a great 5 days in Seminyak by following a few simple rules.
Don't ask the price unless you intend to buy.
Don't ask to see unless you intend to buy.
Be realistic in your haggling.

This is modern day Bali where everyone has a motor scooter and needs to pay high rents to live close enough to the tourist area to work.
These humans that work the beach have families to support and are absolutely flabbergasted when rich tourists who spend $000's to come to Bali then get upset at paying $20 for 2 lounges for 4-5 hours on one of the best spots on the planet.

So!
Be polite and smile.
Learn a little Bahasa (That's Indonesian - Language on business in Bali).
Selamat - Pagi, Siang, Sore (Morning, Afternoon 11-2, Afternoon 2-5)
Tidak Terama Kasih - No thank you
Terama Kasih - Thank you
Satu/Dua/Tiga Jam - One/two/three hours
Mahal - Expensive
Diskoun - Discount please

We came back after 5 years and Kathy still sells Sarongs and does a great back, neck, foot massage, and of course hair braiding.
Billy The Kid and Charlie Brown sell watches and sunglasses.
Denny does an amazing Henna Tattoo - Both my girls got them

And all of this right in font of Ku De Ta, so you can walk up and use the foot/body showers to rinse off the sand/salt in between swims, and of course to head up and grab a delicious snack/lunch. We had lunch there two days and it was fantastic!
Salt and pepper calamaris was great. Great curries and sate. Steak and chips, steak sandwiches etc.
And of course a bar.

Definitely worth a visit and to come back to.

It's a good beach if you don't want to go in it - good for sunset and people watching. But it's a strong current so pointless for swimming - good for surfers.

Nice beach but crowded. Not very good place to go if it is peak season. Good to sit down in evening to watch sunset.

Personally I thing if you're in the area and not planning to spend the day at one of the oh so trendy beach clubs dotted around you're better off at Double Six. The beach is often too wavy for swimming and depending on the time of day it can be quite dirty. If you're nearby it's not a bad way to spend the day, but I certainly wouldn't make an effort.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,285,30>===============  
Not my favourite beach. As it's a public beach, I felt that it was not well maintained. Obviously there's trash everywhere, and because they allow dogs to loiter, watch where you step! You may end up stepping on dog poo - which would be unpleasant. Also there are warungs set up near the entrance to the beach, but no proper trash disposal, so quite smelly unfortunately. Unsightly.

Best beach to have in the morning and evening. You can go around 5.30pm and wait the sunset. Sunset is amazing. Many good cafe.

Lovely clean beaches with a great selection of food choices and bars along the beach strip. Our favourite restaurant for lunch was Champlung for nice relaxing lunch with great variety of food and very cold bintangs. Staff friendly and provide quick service

The Seminyak beach is long and wide, you can walk, walk and walk or stay wherever you want and watch people. Sunsets are so beautiful! Sea is not too quiet but you can still enjoy it. Beach is clean (city workers continuously clean it).

Like others beach in Bali.. Like Kuta, and Legian.. this beach one of best beach to enjoy Sunset in Bali. Worth to Go.. You can walk from Kuta Beach, Legian Beach, Double Six, then Seminyak Beach

Spent many days and nights on Sminyak beach. The beach is huge and when we went in August it was busy enough but not packed. Plenty of bars/restuarants and many sun loungers to lie on, laid on the sand one day but even a light breeze will cover you and you stuff in sand. We generally paid 200K rupiah for two beds, sometimes more, sometimes less. The waves can get quite big so I think it's best to excercise caution, the pull of the sea is incredibly strong and if you're not a strong swimmer (or drunk) you could get into trouble quite quickly. The water was pretty clear.. It's one of the cleaner beaches we visited on the island. Quite a lot of people trying to sell you bracelets, paintings or massages but a smile and a no thank you and they'll leave you alone. Don't let that put you off coming here. At susnset you can sit on beanbags at the numerous restaurants and watch the sun go down while acoustic musicians play/sing. Too many playing Hotel California though! But very chilled way to spend an evening.

Very nice beach, especially for body board and surf. Restaurant and small shops on the beach. At 5 pm just drink a bintang and relax for the sunset show every day !
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,285,30>===============  
Massive tidal movement here so a very very wide beach. The beach itself is OK but wouldn't rush there for a swim. Legian itself is a crazy place after 3pm when the traffic hits town and the Muslims that live here are all trying to get to prayer time.
Other than that go a bit further south for a swim at Tuban. It's on the other sie of Kuta. Quieter, don't need to pay for a sun lounge, just drop your towel and in you go. The water is deeper and so cooler as well. Good friendly people down her.

Relatively clean bearing in mind the numbers using it. Sun beds cheap enough ‚Ç¨6 per person a day. Beach side bars. Plenty of surfers and surfing equipment and training . Normal problem with people selling but they go if you say 'NO'. Sunset is beautiful. A tourist beach but worth a visit

My wife & I spent many hours on this beach drinking and relaxing on the sun beds at Willys Bar. Willy is a great guy, very friendly and accomodating, my wife does'nt like the taste of Bintang so we asked Willy if he would get us some Heiniken in for the following days, we paid him up front for what we thought we would drink and for the next few days we had ice cold Heinikens on call. The boys will also deliver your lunch! Nasi Goreng or Mi Goreng for about $2.50 Au. Great beach good bunch of locals. We visited Oct 2014 and again this year Sept 2015.

This part of the Bali beach i would say is the 'higher end' side of the beach. Not sure if the sand is better; maybe the same. BUT the nice and more expensive restaurants are in Seminyak beach. In any case it's a really long long stretch so even from Kuta you can walk to Seminyak
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,287,40>===============  
This beach has lots of hotels along it that are great to stay in. At night there are places to go along the beach but the day finds it full of tourists. It is a long beach and so is good for a long walk but very hot in the day.

Good beach for you to have a surf lesson. Some local guide can teach you how to surf. The wave is not very big but quiet good for surfing. The beach also very nice for you to relax and sun bathing while you enjoy a bottle of beer.

Me and my friends were staying in Seminyak for a few days and we went to the beach quite a lot. The nice thing about Seminyak beach is that it's less crowded than Kuta beach. There's a lot of nice little bars and restaurants where you can lounge around in a bean bag or have a nice lunch with an ocean view. It has the perfect mix of laid-back and luxurious.

This is a very nice beach if you don't want to travel far from the central area. The sand is not white but the beach itself is really nice as it is very long and lots of little bars along it with bean bags and music. Nice waves to learn how to surf. Clean. And later on at night there is live music and you can see the sunset.

Seminyak beach has 'black' sand and average water clarity. During the day it's all about relaxing, having a coupe of beers and reading a book. If you want a chair and some shade you have to pay around $10-20 per couple. I would recommend heading there in the evening to watch the sunset, have a cocktail and listen to some live acoustic music at one of the many restaurants which supply bean bags and cute colourful shades.

The color of the sea water and the sand is not as what I imagined. The water is not blue, the sand is dark, rough and not white. But I do appreciate the beauty of the Mother Nature there. Strong waves are perfect for surfing. The beach is clean, food is great, though a little expensive - but still worth it! (I stayed there 3 nights and all restaurants in the area turned out amazing). I just wish they have more seafood restaurants that would sell more of lobsters, mantis, crabs... I couldnt find one though, most of the restaurants serve little prawns, sea bass, scallop, some other kinds of fish only. Maybe I would search for more next time.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,288,50>===============  
We stayed at the Pelangi which opens out to the beach. We walked and swam every morning. It is a fun place with surf schools, good surf, kites, restaurants and coffee shops. Lots of people playing on the beach, lounge chairs for hire. At night warungs with cheap food and drink, bean bags and entertainment. Everything a beach should be.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,288,40>===============  
Great beach to sit back relax and watch the day go by.......and the people of course! Only thing is I much prefer an Aussie beach as I would not trust the water or what could be floating in it. Large waves and strong undercurrents. Great place to watch the sun go down though with a beer in hand!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,288,40>===============  
Nice beach but beware as it is also a bit of a foodie tourist trap. Many of the beach sea food restaurants are ushering in customers well above their serving capacity resulting in extreme waiting times. Also check your selected fish isnt stuffed with ice when it goes on the scale for weighing. When you have picked your good restaurant you are almost guaranteed a splendid sunset view
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,289,50>===============  
Choose a bar next to the beach get a beer and enjoy the sunset. Most of places has live music or dj, so the atmosphere of this place at sunset is incredible. You have to see and feel it.

The sand was black, and swimming was prohibited often due to large waves and rips. The beach was nice to take long walks and did have many lounges to hire with umbrellas to give shade. There was a lot of nightlife on the beach which was exciting and colourful and music to enjoy.

I thought I'd go to the beach and relax and read a book. That didn't happen. I was harassed for about two hours by hawkers. I kept saying no and they kept coming. I went to walk away and someone grabbed me and yelled at me for not buying anything.

I would never go back and I am not impressed at all.

Discovered the beach by walking through streets, was crowded and nothing special. Suddenly became bombarbed with people trying to sell me bracelets, henna tattoos, sarongs and even one lady pushing to sell me sarong clips. Feeling very overhwlemd by so many people crowding me for my money and hassling me. The woman selling me the sarong clip made me hold the item and refused to let me give it back. Needless to say after buying 6 bracelets, 2 sarongs, 2 clips and promosing to come back later for henna I left and never went back.

Seminyak Beach is perfect for couples or any solo traveler who desire to experience the beauty of nature. This particular beach in Bali offers tourists with perfect ambiance which enables you to appreciate Balinese beaches. Many resorts and villas are built along the beach, so accessibility is great!

Don't forget to catch the Sunset moments when you are in Semminyak Beach..

My 3rd visit to Seminyak. Going to the beach is always on the itinerary. The sand is fine and clean and it a joy to walk, jog or just stroll especially in the early morning or evening to enjoy the cool breeze. On this 3rd visit, we decided to walk the entire stretch of the beach from Kuta back to Petitengit. It was a most enjoyable hour and a half walk with sandals in our hands, stopping now and then to take photos of the scenery and the people around us building sand castles, flying kites and playing beach volley ball and soccer. We also get the know some of the beautiful hotels, pubs and restaurants along the beach. It was also a good workout before we wash up and head to La Lucciola for our gourmet dinner!

With there being many pretty beaches on bali, seminyak beach is filled with beanbags for maximum chillage. Though the atmosphere is nice it wasn't my kind of beach experience since there were do many people.

Seminyak's Beach offers a more secluded ambiance compared to its sister strands of Kuta and Legian to the south. The atmosphere is much more sophisticated and laid-back than Kuta or Legian, and the beach is quieter during the day.

The beach itself is ok and there are heaps of better beaches around the world but Seminyak has a number of very good bars and restaurants close by.

It's definitely more laid back than Kuta's. Some say its also more sophisticated. Wet part is dominated mostly by surfers, while sandy and dry one, by lazy vacationers under umbrellas. Food and drinks are available too. Decent restaurants and bars are just across the road behind. Some experts would say that fresh young Indonesian meat is for sale here too (mostly in the afternoon though). It has what it takes to have enjoyable few hours.

A beach full of beautiful and colourful cafes/bars. A sunset walk followed by some drinks and dinner under those colourful umbrellas is a good option for chillaxed evenings. But if you want clean sparkling water and silence then this in not the beach. Its got its own charm with a touristy touch.

As we were staying nearby we spent four hours at this beach from 10am-2pm.

The sands are a mixture of the usual colour and light grey, restaurants and hotel pools line the small beach.

There is a lot less people here than at Kuta and Legian beaches so it's ideal if you want a more chilled out beach experience in Bali.

If swimming make sure you take extra care, swimming within the designated areas (flags) and not venturing out too far as the currents are strong. Would definitely not recommended any kids going into the sea.

Overall, a nice beach for a break from the crowds.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,292,40>===============  
The beach all along that coast is lovely and wide. The sand is nice and fine and you can rent loungers and parasols from the various beach bars.

Its the perfect place to watch the sun set while sipping on a cold Bintang.

I visited the place with our little one.

Big beach with lots of good surf. Days of wave did alternate so easy wave days were good for the little ones to paddle and stay safe.

Disappointed though with the cleanness of the beach. Rubbish floating around the waters edge.
Also certain parts smelt so a sewage outlet may have been near by.

The beaches volcanic residue means bathing suits get ruined so only wear dark coloured ones if you plan to do beach sand castle building.

It would have been nice to have more beach restaurants as there were only big ones attached to hotels. The ones that were there had a high security manned setup, so not sure if the Bali bombing in Dec 2004 (?) stopped all all the smaller restaurants doing business.

Would still visit the beach but keep it cleaner please.

Nice long stretch of beach. Good for walks. Seems popular for surfing. The bars and music along the beach set the holiday scene.
Occasionally there are sewerage run offs which smell pretty unpleasant. Didn't entice me to swim.
I hear the sunsets are spectacular but unfortunately the volcanic ash created such a haze, that the sun was swallowed by thick cloud and no sunsets were to be enjoyed.

I guess a surfer who grew up riding the beautiful spots on Sydney's Northern Beaches is going to have a tough measuring stick!

Not a great beach break, however I did get one memorable 177m / 28.7km ride. No headlands or reefs of interest. The trade-winds blow cross-shore fairly early in the day.

You can rent deck chairs. Shopping and bar in the area are good. Potatohead and Ku De Ta are great - Check em out. Better of surf the Bukit Peninsula!

Love the soft sands and calming sea! We went to the beach around the evening so it is great to look at. At night, there are a lot of restaurants that will set up chairs and table at the beach. You get to listen to the sound of the waves as you dine. A great experience indeed! however, you have to plan your route around tot he beach. The first time when we arrived, we were not clear of how to go and ended up arriving after the sun sets. We went there for a second time to catch the sunset. A tip, plan and ask clearly on how to go!

Lovely beach, interesting waves, loads of food, it's like the perfect set up, but the open sewers running onto and across the beach, which people ignore and simply walk through, kind of grosses me out. It's like this on other beaches along this southern stretch of coast too so it's just one of those things. Unless you want to walk for miles along the beach you may not even notice it. I noticed it a lot! The touts are there but they are not aggressive or persistent. Mainly just selling sarongs and paintings and sometimes quite odd things. But they don't pressure or annoy, they are just there. Unlike the JetSki and paragliding touts in Patong who block your path and follow you and won't leave you alone!

Horse back riding.
Back massage.
Manicure
Pedicure
Foot scrub
Temporary tattoo
Hair braides
Learn to wake board / surf

Just soak up the sun and zzzzzz under the umbrella as you lay on the beach chair. Charges for 3 hours is 100,000 Rupiah. Full day - walk around and ask best price - haggle like crazy. Then pick a good spot to unwind.

While peddlars are lesser than say Kuta and Denpasar beach, be firm when they start peddling you trinklets and unwanted services. Eye contact with them - Dont. They come and surround you like bees to a flower.

Take a stroll along the coastline. I couldnt as I sprain my foot. Yet the peddlars were most understanding and made me more comfortable. Pedicure, foot scrub, nail varnish and back massage by three ladies. And free trinklets - wrist bands

Bring a beach towel should you find the chairs rental steep. Bottled water, sun screen / block, hat, sunglasses and a good book.

What I was looking for - a hammock under coconut trees to lay down with coconut juice / water. Alas.... bean bags and beach chairs aplenty.

Great surfing beach that is very affordable compared to US and LatAm even. Beers also are abundant and cheap.
Not the most amazing beach in the world. Dont go there if you are expecting the famous picturesque clear water Bali beaches. Probably better to go to Nusa Dua.
Also, the water is a bit dirty unfortunately :(
End the day at KuDeTa or Potato Head for fancier drinks

Seminyak beach was clean with plenty of dark yellow sand. Surf breaks seemed consistent. Swimming was confined to a few patrolled areas. Few vendors to annoy you. Plenty of restaurants fronting the beach. Multiple lounges for hire. Popular spot for local dog owners to exercise their pets although they were never a problem for beach goers. Nothing to make it a must visit beach over other Bali beaches.

Seminyak Beach is a long straight stretch of surf beach, heavily built up and used by one and all! Edged by resorts, locals, cafes & beach shops, with resident dogs,it is inclined to collect rubbish from far & wide, but is "groomed" each morning so is OK. I wouldn't swim in the surf... local streams drain into it! Great for early walks to get appetite up to indulge a breakfast, or wonderful sunset viewing as you sip your cocktails!

While the sea bed gently slopes down, unless one is a very powerful swimmer, one needs to exercise caution here as the rip currents are very strong here.

One of the most beautiful sunsets I ever seen was here, in the beach of Seminyak where the sun drops down in a mix of beautiful colors.

This beach has a bit of something for everyone. It seems a bit north of Jl. Camplung Tanduk is the quieter area with lots of rentable beach chairs and space for water activities. It was far from overcrowded. South of the street began the row of bars, restaurants, and related party atmosphere. Much more crowded. Lots of conflicting noises on that side. But there were plenty of waves when we visited and the water is warm. Some dogs around but they mostly prefer the sunshine to people. So it's a nice public beach everyone (adults and families alike) can enjoy.

Having spent a week on the east coast at Sanur, I can safely say Seminyak's beach is far better, hands down. It's sandier, lighter and cleaner, plus it has much bigger and more impressive waves and fabulous sunsets. My family happily spent all day on the beach watching the surfers at play. The only negative is the hawkers trying to flog you their kites, hats, sarongs and watches. That said compared to other tourist hotspots they were not at all aggressive and quickly moved on after a quick no.

We were staying at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa with attractive infinity pool overlooking the beach. I did spot two cheeky families rock up to the beach in front and then let their children enter the hotel pool. The hotel security didn't bat an eyelid, which was disappointing. Anyway it's a great beach, not at all crowded and the sunset views are pretty special. No need to traipse all the way over to join the crowds at Tanah Lot.

Lovely long beach with white sand huge waves. Strong current at times. Lots of restaurants for lunch and dinners and absolutely amazing in the evening with after-beach cushions and lanterns. SO romantic.
Beach chairs with umbrella is exensive. 300 000 ruphies for a day for 2 beds. However, sunbeds are super luxury so really a treat but if you plan to go to the beach everyday it adds up. Especially if you are a big family.

Worth the visit if staying in the area. It's more of a beach than lovina and is nice to walk along. Water seemed clean and there are areas with good waves.

The beach often has big waves and is rough, so its not great for swimming. It also has not got the best waves for surfing either, but every now and then the banks are ok. The beach club is very nice to hang out at and the vibe for tanning and having some drinks is pretty cool to. Dark sand and just not up there with many other beaches.

This was a awesome beach we visited while in Seminyak region. It has high waves, but the beach is shallow, so we could go in and enjoy the waves. Very good beach for surfers due to good high waves.
The sand is packed and dense, so one can easily walk on beach and enjoy long strolls.
The beach is very near to the famous Seminyak Square.

I consider myself a bit of an expert on nice beaches. Seminyak is a great beach with nice sand. It's a very wide beach, and when the tide is out it can be 200 meters or more wide. There is no drop off, and the bottom is sandy. Great for surfing, body surfing and swimming. There are some rip currents when the surf is big, so pay attention to the flags. You can also rent chairs with umbrellas if you don't want to lay in the sand. Plenty of restaurants on the beach, and great for sunsets. I'd give it 5 stars,but‚Ä¶ there is a definite problem with the amount of plastic garbage that washes up on the beach. And here's my suggestion - the government should take a portion of the entry tax they collect and hire people to pick up the beach. People work for very little in Bali. Start on one end and just pick it up. With tourism seemingly the main industry in Bali, I'm surprised they don't do a better job. And the hawkers can become a bit much as well. I mean, I don't really need a painting of an elephant or buddah.

Seminyak beach is a great place to go for so many possibilities. Deserted or almost so in early morning for a great run on the beach (half marathon distance possible !), crowded in the evening with seaside bars pumping their music, great waves to enjoy, many fantastic restaurants to eat in if you venture a bit into the streets, great shopping within walking distance, the occasional ceremony with Balinese people gathering to let their offerings go into the sea, an evening drink at La Luciola. Yes, Seminyak is polluted, too crowded and not as authentic as it used to be 15 years back but it's still one of the best place to visit in the area !

We heard so much about Seminyak Beach therefore we decided to visit this popular place on a weekday. We walked for about 15 minutes from Seminyak Square and reached the beach through KudeTa at about 5.00pm. The beach was quite crowded with both locals and foreigners, and there were a lot of sellers who approaches you all the time with their junks. The beach is not that clean compared to those on the eastern side of the island.

The beach was not pleasant at all. The sand was streaked with black, obviously from oil, which meant there weren't very many people on the beach either. I suspect that it's visited mainly in the late afternoon evening due to all the bars/restaurants on the beach, but in the morning it's just gross.

The beaches in the built up areas of Bali are a bit hit and miss. Unfortunately the practice of making offerings the the Gods on the beach, Many of which containing, plastic wrapped lollies and cigarettes, leads to a beaches strewn with debris. It is such a shame.

Went there for the sunset. The beach is really pretty and crowded. Good mix of locals and foreigners. However the toilets are very rundown and doesn't offer much privacy, so you should wear your swimwear there, otherwise it is hard to change.

I love Seminyak Beach with its long stretches of sand and surf! It is a great place to take a long walk or run before the sun gets too hot, and then a swim afterwards. I enjoyed a lounger and drink on the beach, but made a mistake when making a purchase with a hawker of goods. One buy and I was inundated with people trying to sell me overpriced goods. I found that my no must have sounded more like a yes to them, because I ended up with foot and hand massages, plucked eyebrows, jewellery and other goods, most of which I paid too much for. But for all that, I did enjoy myself! I learnt a huge lesson on not being a sucker for a friendly lady who had supposedly not made any sales that day as she had just come a funeral! I had a good laugh that day and did come away with a sense of fun and joy even though I had been shamelessly been taken advantage of. You just need to be stronger than me!

Aaah... this is hard to write. I love being by the ocean and on a beach, and this beach has pros and cons.

The views of the sunset are outstanding at this beach. There are many eating and drinking possibilites everywhere, and the ocean is clean if a little rough - hence the amount of surfers that congregate here to do their thing.

The road leading to the beach is constantly busy with mopeds and Vespa-like vehicles. It is something to watch the weaving in and out fo these riders, and it's a wonder how they do not fall off their vehicles, or hit people or things as they go... but they don't!

What I didn't care for was the constant being asked to buy things from the local sellers on the beach. In truth I felt sorry for them. They were only trying to make a living by selling local stuff to tourists. But mostly, the tourists just want a beach holiday without the albeit friendly (but intrusive and cnstant all the same) harassment to buy all kinds of stuff. I was only here four days, but it really began to get on my nerves by the end of the second day.

The beach itself might disappoint someone if they were epecting tropical white sandy beaches... the sand is a dark brown/grey due to its volcanic origin.

All in all, not my favourite beach in the world, but I can see me being on it again, once I have forgotten how annoying the sellers can be.

There's no better way to unwind after a hot day walking the Seminyak streets for a bargain or visiting the local attractions than to sit on Seminyak beach. Take in the sunset while sitting in the Seminyak sand drinking a beer or cocktail. The many local establishments serve light meals and drinks amongst beanbags and dim lights.

We like to meet up with friends along this section of the beach, rent 2 long chairs and umbrella for 50,000rp for the day and then make sure to swim between the flags as there are strong rips along the beach.

Crazy, never seen a beach commercialized like this. Now view as all the umbrellas and beach chairs take up all the natural space. Sad. Rainy season its full of trash due to the winds & currents as rains wash rubbish into the seas. Island of the Gods must be pissed. Bukit beaches or outside the commercial zones are more pleasant. However there can be nice sunsets from that side.

Seminyak beach in June was pretty clean and rubbush free (for a Bali beach). It was great to people watch with Ex-Pats walking their 'horse-like' dogs and locals participating in ceremonies as the sun rises.
The sand is still pretty grey but the setting is lovely worth the effort of a walk in the steamy air.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,304,50>===============  
You should be there in the morning and sunset! The endless Indian Ocean makes you WOW! Some people jog on the beach in the morning and some people walk their dogs in the noon time. I love it day and night!

Well we found it to be very dirty the sand after walking a short distance leaves a blackish residue on your feet, so for us walking along the pathways beside the beach was fine. We found much the same conditions at other beaches, however one very positive note, the sunsets are spectacular. For the rest of our flexible holiday we headed inland, maybe no ocean but jungle is something else. Additionally where we live in Australia we are right on the beach so perhaps a little spoilt!

We walked from our resort in Seminyak down the beach to Legian. Took about an huor and was enjoyed by mum, dad and 4 kids. Lots of beach bars/resorts along the way to buy drinks. Also a few hagglers selling sunglasses which was funny for the kids to deal with

We stayed at the beach and walked in the surf every morning. The food is so good with a view of the sunset. We enjoyed the fitness room, too!

Since it was an anniversary trip, the hotel upgraded us to a beautiful suite with a private pool at the Garden. This morning, I saw huge lizard about 2 feet long. He was afraid of me and hurriedly dove into the pond and swam away. There are beautiful grounds, flowers, and solicitous staff. It is truly a paradise.
Tonight, we are going on an elephant ride in the sunset.

We are blessed with some fabulous beaches in Australia so comparisons are dangerous. Seminyak had dirty surf on the couple of times we hit the beach (the pool at the villa was much more inviting!). Like most beaches, it pays to swim where it's safe and listen to the lifeguards - we did see one mature gentleman saved from a rip.

Mmmm....not for me.....too much 'stuff' littering the beach. Even though a tractor travels along the beach 'raking' it is not so effective. After rain the water looks disgusting and dumping waves serve as caution to bathers.

Huge long beach with mild surf. It's very flat, you can walk about 150 to 200 meters towards the sea before hitting the water. Wind was great for kite flying. Very safe for young children. Sand blackish, but fine. Only problem with beach was slight unpleasant smell of rotting vegetation.

We rent a bodyboard, a sunbed and we spent the whole day at Seminyak Beach! One of the best activities I did, very affordable (110K for the day for two). The beach in itself is nice, not the most beautiful one in Bali but not too overcrowded.

Wide black sand beach, suitable for novice surf board riders. Not great for swimmers. In fact, the only people in the water were kids, learning to ride boards
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,306,30>===============  
The beach was a great place to pull up a bean bag and listen to some music whilst watching the sunset and the waves roll in. You can also surf although the waves weren't overly big, I think if your looking for surf maybe you need to go to Echo Beach or other surf beaches with bigger waves.

The dislike about the beach is the black sand.

Has a wide beach area where one can enjoy a nice walk in the evening watching the sunset. Very clean. The noise from the seafront restaurants starts from sundown which is a negative

Absolutely loved the sunset view from out hotel room. If you plan on staying in Seminyak, it's best to stay in W Retreat or any beach front villas. Seminyak is so populated and commercialized now, so staying in a secluded area is rewarding.

Seminyak beach is a beautiful beach. You can find plenty of vendors for beach benches and umbrellas at reasonable rates. If some one is interested in surfing, there are a couple of surfing schools right on the beach. One thing to be careful about is where you get your money exchanged for local currency. You will find plenty of small shops claiming to be 'authorized currency dealers', however a vast majority of them give you less money than what is mentioned at the shop entrance.Particularly, one member of their team will distract you with general questions while the person handling the currency will hand you less money than what they owe you. So always count the money yourself even if the shop owners counted it in fornt of you. We wound " Central K" group of shops very reliable when it came to money exchange. If you are looking of good art work and wood work, I would recommend buying it from Ubud where you will find products with better quality.

I was very disappointed in my trip here having heard so much about Seminyak and its beach
Really this is just one very long beach that stretches from Kuta and beyond Seminyak.
With so many 'world' restaurants I was hard pressed to find one serving the local food.
the beach vendors (of which there are many) were pushy which added to my sad trip to this place.
Basically the tourists have pretty much ruined these places in Bali, too many people for the infrastructure and everyone trying to get their $ from the tourists (and you cannot blame them)
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,307,50>===============  
This is a broad, fairly maintained, if a bit rough patch of surf. We walked up and down it at least once. There were a few people out. Some fisherman to avoid, too.

When I stay at one of the budget hotels in the area of Seminyak, the next morning I decided to wake up early to enjoy the sunrise on Seminyak Beach.

It only takes about 5 minutes to walk from the hotel to the beach.
You can enjoy the morning air of Seminyak area.

And alsomany people who ran or cycled in the morning.

Nice scenery in the morning!

The Seminyak beach is located not really far from Kuta. The place itself is cleaner than Kuta, but please don't expect less crowd here. My visit was during the sunset time and it was a pleasurable experience. Watching the sun goes down, looking at the sky, and hear the wave voice, so amazing! I would love to come back again to enjoy this beautiful view!

After having come from the southern tip of Bali I stayed in Seminyak at the W. I had an incredible ocean view room and slept and woke to this vivacious beast-the Indian Ocean. It was very different from the Southern Bali ocean experience of calm and quiet. The beach had a lot of dog walkers so wear shoes. But expect to take them off when there's a breech in the sand and you have to wade through a bit of water to get to continue your beach walk. This side of the island seemed risky to be in the Ocean.

Serioulsy? Bali may once have been a cheap place to go but that is no longer the case in Seminyak at least so there is little to justify spending a lot of money to leave Australia for the purpose of beach-going. The beach is uninteresting and uninviting. The surf is large and the water murky. The sand is grey. Unsurprisingly no one swims there!

Depending on what you like this beach may be good or bad for you.Beach front is mostly occupied by big hotels and there are only few local restaurants .You can hardly find any local vendors selling eatables here .On the positive side crowd is not much and if you prefer to relax in a quiet place ;best place for you.

The beach is quite long, and there's plenty of space to roam. Unfortunately, it is also frequented by hawkers who can be quite intrusive and annoying. If one ventures far enough, it is not uncommon to walk into areas covered in garbage... the smell of which lingers in the air.

As long as one stays within the areas in front of/near the luxury beach side resorts, it would be difficult to find anything to complain about. The sand is soft and welcoming, and the water is clear. The tide can be a bit strong in areas (there are multiple advisories that recommend against swimming), which can be restrictive if one wants some semblance of privacy.

If you want to walk forever this is the perfect beach to do so, even if there is lots of people this beach is huge and lots of room to share, when the tide is low, the sand is perfect for jogging and speed walking, locals play soccer on th beach and it is a very oriented activity beach, standup paddle, surfing, boogieboard etc...The sand is not white but clean and pebble free, no need for shoes on the beach or in the water. It is clean in general compare to KUTA and LEGIAN but still some garbages in the water, they try to maintained it clean with workers in the morninsg which is nice to see. Lots of little paying spots to park your body and lay in the sun all day with shades and umbrellas. from having travel all over bali, this beach has it all, little restaurants to fancy Hollywood type bar and lounges to hotel and epxensive villa. really appreciated the time spend there and did not wanted to go at first. Amazing sunset and accessible to all.

The Beach is perfectly right in the heart of the most famous spot in Bali, Seminyak has become a destination to visit not just for the foreigners but it also become a lifestyle gigs for the local tourist, you can go in the sunset time to this beach and you will see how people likes to hangout and see the sunset together with friends and colleague...

The surf was excellent, and beautiful to watch. The sand was not golden, but dark coloured and I know you shouldn't compare, but not a patch on Qld beaches. The sand was so damn hot, couldn't walk on it, even with thongs......plenty of lounges which was excellent. Such a shame though to see so many hawkers and their filthy makeshift stands, really spoils the beach, but totally understand that tourism is their source of income. With labour being so cheap, it wouldn't be too difficult to clean it all up and have containers for their storage of stuff made colourful and clean, would be so more appealing and tourist would be more keen to buy stuff.

Busy beach with many sewage water flows and swimming plastics. Not suitable for a swim, also due to dangerous currents. However, nice sunset watching.

This is the must do beach. All of the hotspots of Seminyak can be accessed from the beach. The water is not best compared to other parts of Bali but overall good. Downside is all of the vendors trying to sell you stuff which takes away from the relaxation time. Be sure to checkout one of the bars closer to Kuta to sit out on the bean bags and watch the sunset. Pretty kewl at night.

I came here early in the morning for a morning walk... from the entrance I entered into the beach it seems ok in terms of cleanliness, just that it's not that kind of white sandy beach...
As we walk further down the beach, we started to see plastic bags partially buried under the sand and also a broken part of a beer bottle, which is glass floating at the shoreline...
And further down, there's a foul smell... Then we spotted a drain flowing into the sea! Omg!
What others mentioned in their reviews I read before my trip is genuine!!! It's the most DISGUSTING beach I have ever been!
I'm lucky that I did not get any injury from the broke glass and no skin allergy issues from the dirty water from the drain.
I will NEVER Go back to this beach again!
Go at your own risk!
Suggest to better spend your time exploring other beaches further from Seminyak Beach!

Came to this beach two times over two days, and teh second day was too much. The hawkers are quite annoying, and persistent, they will come back every hour to offer you the same item you already turned down. One lady started touching my feet while I was asleep suntanning on a chair, that bothered me, although she wanted to sell me a foot massage, I didn't appreciate her touching me unexpected and unwanted.
What is great here though are the lounge chairs with an umbrella for 50K/ all day, and there is surfing and many good beach restaurants with bean bag chairs and cheap ice cold Bintang. Stick around for a beautiful sunset and cocktail. All you need is one day here, any more than that and the garbage, hawkers and smells may bother you.

This definitely had lesser people than the kuta beach but still was quite crowded.Its a long beach and a must visit if you are in seminyak.We spent the evening having dinner at one of restaurants along the beach-even-though the food wasn't great,the ambiance and sitting on those comfy informal seating where you can lie down and gaze at the sky and the stretching horizons was a memorable experience.

As a natural Beach you will have to travel far to find something as pristine as this. however depending on the time of the year it can be really busy. most annoying are the "Traders". it is a continious pattern of trying to sell you something. From Kites to Watches.

I don't think you go to Bali for the beaches...and if you do my friend, there is quite a bit of the world for you to see yet.

The beach in Seminyak was a dull grey colour...quite a few pieces of rubbish on the sand...a lot of bad smells and frankly you'd pay me (a heck of a lot) to go for a swim there.

Visitors please do care. Bali is a wonderful place but it has, as in any developing countries, a lot of work to be done in terms of getting their sewage sorted. At this point a lot of it ends up...yes you've got it! in the spot where you want to go swim! So go back to your resort and jump in the pool!

The beach is nice and clean. As it is a very touristy spot it is of course crowded.
There are also some people that are trying to sell things on the beach.
When we were there, the current was pretty strong so we couldn't go in the water really.

My wife and I were staying at the Double Six Luxury Hotel, so the beach is merely right in front of the hotel. The Hotel even has a security cordoned off area with lounges for guests to enjoy the scenery and the sunset.

We were delivered to the beach by golf cart from our hotel. The sand is grey and gritty. The number of people on the beach reflected the state of tourism currently in Bali - it was practically deserted. There were the usual annoying hawkers but a couple of acceptable beach cafes. The surf today (23/04/2015) was poor though a few diehards were out. Not a very inspiring place.

The sun setting over the water was amazingly beautiful.
The rolling waves looked like they should have far more people enjoying them.
The walks along the beach were lonely - traveling solo, and not many fellow walkers.
The sand was more like dirt than sand
The rubbish on the foreshore indicated that no-one really cared.

This seems like a great area of the beach, if you can embrace the hawkers, or at least not have them detract from your experience.

The bars along the beach are well set-up to cater for those wanting a drink or a meal, with comfy bean-bags and umbrellas.

First thing in the morning is great for running along the beach, with packed sand from the tide.

Not much more to do in Seminyak then lying on the beach and go shopping < although there are some original (clothing) shops there, do expect to see a lot of Aussi surf brands there too ...

Found little of Indonesian/ Bali culture left ....
Very 'touristic' and the streets are quite busy during 6-10 in the evening.
Many street sellers, taxis/ cars, beach sellers and a general over-population ...
Maybe this is a 'natural' development, and me being part of it should not complain so much, but nevertheless I found the visit a bit .... disappointing ... and probably will not return there.

If you do go, make sure to visit restaurant Sate Bali, so at least you get some beautiful & tasty 'Bali food'!

The further away you go from Kuta Beach towards Seminyak, the beach becomes less crowded and that's one of the things I like about Seminyak Beach.

There are a few bars, restaurants, and beach resorts along the beach and also a warung (food stall) along the beach. Warung Cantina and Mosaic Beachclub are located on the northwestern end of the beach. Potato Head beachclub is located more towards the Kuta side of the beach.

Closer to Kuta the beach can sometimes stink of sewerage, and that's one of the reason I avoided the Kuta side of the beach. The further northwest you go, the beach is less crowded and more nicer. A good place to see the sunset too. Very beautiful.

You can also hire pool chairs and umbrellas from the locals for a cheap price and enjoy the view and the breeze.

Warning...please be careful when using the money changers in the few shops outside the Ku De Ta. they are called the Big Boss money change and they ripped us off for RP700,00 approx ¬£30 even though I counted the money 4 times, they still managed the slip notes out. They bambosle you with RP50,000 notes and try to distract you. I know ¬£30 is not a lot but when you are on a budget that can be 3 meals. Made me very distrustful of people and ruined Seminyak for me. Beach lovely but vendors renting sunbeds also tried ripping us off asking for RP200,00 for 2 hours, rather sit on the sand. In sanur, sunbeds RP40,000 - RP50,000 for all day. Even though we stayed in Seminyak we ventured into Kuta which we preferred in the long run

I recently stayed at the W Hotel on Seminyak Beach. I'd researched prior to my visit, so knew this wasn't going to be a place of beauty in Bali. The beach was fine, however the water was too rough to swim in. There were a few people out surfing and a couple of locals in the sea further down the beach. The litter wasn't too bad (I understand it's much worse during the Wet season). If you're looking for a beautiful beach on the island of Bali, I suggest you go elsewhere.

I stayed with my family at the Royal Beach Seminyak Resort/Hotel for three nights. We had come out to the beach area adjacent to the hotel grounds after dinner. Both times the tide was very low, and we could walk a long distance before we finally hit the water. The night was clear and the sky had a quarter moon surrounded by bright stars, We had taken some beautiful photos despite the darkness.

When staying in bali, this was our local beach. That said we spent most of the time visiting other beaches around bali.

Some evenings however were spent on the beach and the sunset here is great! We took so many great photos here.

We spent a day on the beach towards the end of the holiday and we're pleasantly surprised. Admittedly it's not as attractive as perhaps geger or nusa dua, but the sand is far softer on the feet!

We rented sunbeds (make sure you haggle!) and a bodyboard and the waves were great. Quite powerful at times so be careful with these as there's quite a lot of pull and push going on with the water. One minute you're being pushed towards the beach, the next you're being dragged back out.

Overall though it's a lovely beach, great for sunbathing, bodyboarding or surfing...possibly not the best for a swim due to the waves. There aren't many places to buy drinks nearby apart from a few bars (eg ku de ta or potato head) so take some with you. There's loads of sellers down there with watches, glasses, hats etc which can get a little annoying...but after a few no's, they tend to leave you alone.

Generally though, this was a good beach. Not the best in Bali but worth a visit if you're nearby. Would go again and recommend to others.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,316,30>===============  
There were lots of rental for chair and umbrella. The beach area was nice but recommend to wear a sandal to walk on the sand, it gets very hot during the late morning. There were lots of garbage came back from the wave and it wasn't pleasant to stay in the water to long.

OK, the actual beach is pretty grim - used syringes and nappies washed up. But go to one of the beach bars to watch the sunset, you will not be disappointed. Just steer clear of the actual shoreline, if you want a strip of sand go further up towards Potato Head

it really doesnt matter what part of this kuta stretch of coastline you spend your beach days on , but certainly there are less beach hawkers the further you get away from the actual kuta stretch of beach . there also seems to be more facilities seminyak stretch opposite the beach more restaraunts etc , and I also reckon the corn on the cob vendor has the best grilled corn in bali which is saying something , seminyak also has the best warungs near by too as well as the best tour coordinator in all of indonesia called Seminyak transport community. his name is Ian and he makes everything happen without the hassles and rip offs .cheers

I wish I could give Seminyak a better review, but every day I was there was a wasted day of an otherwise amazing trip. I was told not to expect much from the beaches but I did not expect the amount of trash and wasted that laid everywhere. Both Kuta and Seminyak streets were crowded with motor bikes and cars which made it really difficult to walk the streets comfortably. If you would like to visit this area I would suggest staying only 1-2 days if that. The best would be to take a day trip there from another area that is less crowded.

Seminyak is the dining capital of Bali, with some really upscale restaurants in their own private bays. I've rated some of these individually.

As far as south Bali goes Seminyak is number one,- in beach cleanliness, accommodation, shopping & dining.
It is comparable to Candi Dasa in the N.E.

It's a beautiful beach that has unfortunately been spoiled with polution & rubbish. Personally I would not swim at the beaches between Kuta & Seminyak. It's definitely worth venturing out further if you're a beach lover.

The Seminyak Beach is not as busy as Kuta. Along the beach frontage are a number of restaurants that have bean bags and tables on the beach which you can sit down and be waited on for dinner, drinks and enjoy the sunset view to boot. Very enjoyable and relaxing.

We took a motor bike to check out the beaches and went to Seminyak beach first of a few. We were not impressed by all the rubble and rubbish lying around. It is also dangerous with a very strong under tow which got me by the ankles and within seconds had me off my feet and sucking me out deeper. Very scary so you need to take care. Nice place to have a relaxing drink and cool down. Friendly bar/stall owners but still get harassed by people selling things.

I've been to seminyak beach about 20 or more times, my experience:

-trash washes up all day, they take it 2 x daily and dispose.
-be prepared for aggressive beach sellers walking up and down, all selling the same junk...also if you buy from one they will swarm you and target you even more.
-numerous nearby beach bars and snack sellers for cheap refreshment.
-getting a chair and umbrella about 50k for the day, they will try to charge you more
-great waves for surfing.

Conclusion: the beaches in this area of bali (seminyak, legion, kuta) all pretty much the same. Better to do pool clubs if you can afford it!

Of course beaches get dirty, generally the busier they are the more rubbish lazy people leave behind. Admittedly I visited in March which is well out of season but the litter levels were minimal. The water is warm, there can be a strong undertow so pay attention to the warning flags. At the North end of the beach is an area set aside for Hindu ceremonies so avoid that. Further north is the local "gay" beach and if you walk south you will get to Kuta beach. Plenty of surf shacks, drinks stalls, bars and local sales people are available here too.

I really love spending time here. Usually I came here around 4, pick a spot at Taris Bali, and then go swimming or just playing on the beach until 5. After that, I dry myself and then just enjoy my cold beer on a comfy beanbag. On some nights, you can also enjoy live music at Taris Bali.

Seminyak Beach is MUCH cleaner than Kuta. Plenty of bars on the beach with chairs to sit on, and reasonably priced drinks, usually 25,000 (about $2 US). Sunsets are AMAZING!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,318,30>===============  
It's a shame that an upscale resort like Seminyak doesn't have a better beach than this. Whilst not without its good parts, large areas are dirty and full of rubbish making them unpleasant to walk on. I know this is the case for many of Bali's beaches but surely something could be done to minimise the mess.

That said, it's a great place to eat, drink, relax, swim, surf, body board or whatever. Comfy sunbeds with parasols can be rented at 100k rupia for two per day and watching the sea is mesmerising. There's always something going on and someone trying to sell you something!

We were so disappointed and quite disgusted. The beach along Kuta, Legion and Seminyak was dirty and full of rubbish. We spent 10 days in Bali and did not swim in the beach once, thankfully the places we stayed at had great swimming pools. For such a popular tourist spot, something needs to be done about this problem. Maybe starting with educating people about rubbish disposal.

really liked seminyak beach during the day. The sand is clean as is the sea. The waves are quite strong and there are lots of beginner surf lesions going on in the mornings as there are more waves than in the afternoon when the tide goes way out. There are a few beach restaurants for a nice lunch and the sunset was also gorgeous. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people hassling you to buy hats, sunglasses etc all day and the beach chairs are not cheap. Didn't get to see the beach at night due to the Nyepi festival, everywhere was closed!

Just came back from a couple of weeks in Seminyak and Canggu. It was so disappointing to see all of the rubbish on the beach and in the water. I have been going to Bali since the early 1980s and have been progressively concerned about the over-development along the lower west coast and pollution. There was actually too much rubbish in the water for my wife and I to swim this time (plastic rubbish and probably worse). I love the Balinese people but the rubbish and water quality is becoming unacceptable here. Don't think that I will return.

A beautiful view and not too crowded. The downside is the amount of locals trying to sell their products that cannot accept 'no thank you' as an answer. Also you have to pay to sit on the beach loungers that cover the beach. 150,000IDR for three of us.

We decided for a walk on the beach and maybe a swim. Once we got down to it we were disgusted by the sight of it, its just full of rubbish, filthy and stinks bad.

It is great to walk up and down this very expansive beach in front of many hotels. You can see the jets flying from the Denpasar airport in the distance.

This is a big negative but we were still able to capture many awesome photos of the surf and sky.

Seminyak Beach is a beautiful beach to look at. Unfortunately, any beach in Bali would be pretty polluted. As someone who grew up in Indonesia, I wish we'd paid more attention to keeping our beautiful country clean, but it was just never a priority and hopefully that's changing soon and our environment would be getting a little more TLC. Seminyak, Legian and other beaches along this coastline are great for surfing, body/boogie boarding, and watching the sunset. They are not good for swimming or snorkeling as the waves are too big. If you walk along the stretches of private beaches (exclusive to resort guests), they are likely to be clean, but go into the water and you'll likely spot some garbage (plastic bags, paper towel, piece of stick, anything you can think of) floating around.

As far as the area itself, Seminyak is a hot spot, second busiest to Kuta with an older, slightly more sophisticated crowd. There are cute little shops, both modern and traditional restaurants, and bars with happy hour deals and live entertainment just about any night of the week. On the weekends (especially Saturday night), the place is a zoo. If you're looking for a little peace and quiet, you probably won't find it in Seminyak unless it's off-season and/or you're staying at a resort with a private beach.

If you are looking to swim or do other water sports, Tanjung Benoa, Nusa Dua and beaches on the other coast would be much better. Plus, they also tend to be cleaner.

If you go during rainy season, just understand in advance that the beach will probably be dirty and trash-ridden. My husband and I went late February and had this expectation beforehand so weren't surprised although it was still disappointing and disheartening to see. We did observe many people raking but it's probably difficult to stay ahead of all the trash washing on the shore. While it's not super bad to deal with, I wouldn't come to Bali just for the beaches and hope anyone traveling out of their way to come here would do their research and plan to spend more time inland. But if you are looking to spend time on the beach and happen to come to Bali during rainy season, you'll probably enjoy the southern (e.g. Pecatu) or eastern coast (maybe Nusa Dua) more.

What a disappointment. Miles of beach covered in litter that no-one picks up. Good surf but filthy. We surfed there last Friday & could only cope for 5 minutes due to the sheer amount of plastic in the water. If there is that much rubbish in the water there's bound to be faeces & bacteria in it. Sadly the locals don't seem to care that it deters tourists.

Unfortunately we won't go back to Bali again, apparently all the beaches on Bali have the problem.

The beaches when we were there this month were covered in rubbish brought to the Bali beaches with the currents, very unfortunate. The tractors are busy in the morning doing what they can to clean up, this being funded by some of the hotels along Seminyak Beach. The government sadly, we were told does not contribute to the clean up. There is a transformation late afternoon when the sun starts to dip into the sea, families, locals and visitors all flock to the beaches to enjoy the cooler weather, the bean bag beach clubs, and to play soccer. Its a great atmosphere even though its crowded. Colored umbrellas color the horizon. These clubs seem to start north of Double Six Rd. Expect traffic jams as half of Bali spills onto the beach at sunset! Hawkers do still try to tempt you with an array of selfie sticks, bracelets, kites and sarongs. Great place to watch the world go by sipping a Mojito or two while listening to live music. Thankyou Bali!

Bali beaches are not clean but they are raked and cleaned regularly. In peak season they are done more frequently, when I went in June they were a lot cleaner.
Hawkers are a nuisance but you get used to it, it is their income and means of living.
Theives and pick pockets are rife so watch what you carry with you.
It was a good time of year to walk along the beach as it was so much quieter with a lot less tourists than in the month of June. In June it was so packed it was uncomfortable.

Traveled from the UK based on the reviews from other posts about Seminyak beach.
After a not so pleasant check in, we decided to take a walk down to the beach. We were hounded by the taxi drivers and young men on the motorbikes asking if we needed a ride!!!!!!
First impressions of the beach were very disappointing, I was hoping to find clear blue waters and a soft clean sandy beach.
However, the beach was littered with plastic bottles, empty bags and wrappers,etc.
Bali needs to ensure that their beaches are kept clean, after all, we tourists spend thousands of pounds to visit here.
We were deliberately short changed twice at two of the local minute marts. Second time it happened, I pointed this out and I got the correct change after annoying looks from the staff!
Don,t stop to ask the price of anything as you will get ripped off.
Avoid the taxis at any cost.
Only use BLUE BIRD TAXI as they all use the meter any other taxi will hustle you major and pretend to be BLUE BIRD, and avoid random men stopping in their cars asking you if you need a lift.
Keep your wallets and bags close as I felt uncomfortable when the men kept stopping on their motorbikes and trying to talk to us.
The sole purpose of the locals is to try and rip you off, it,s best not to entertain them or try and hold any conversation.
For a country with such potential to create a amazing experience, it,s sadly let down by dirty beaches, street hustles and overly aggressive locals at every three meters!
I would not recommend Bali as a honey moon destination, it is really for the young surfers and backpackers.
Don,t waste all your hard earned cash to come here.

this beach is of black sand and the beach is full of litter and crap, nowhere near clean. it looks like a tractor runs along the length of it every morning to try and scrape up the garbage washed up on the beach. you also get pestered by sellers of beach chairs and shade as you walk along. not the best beaches for me.

I visited several beaches in Bali during my 3 weeks there and I found this to be one of the most beautiful and peaceful spots on the island. There were plenty of surfers and locals to make the time people watching pass with joy! Very beautiful at sunset!

The Seminyak Beach is very nice as the sand is perfectly smooth (although also very hot!). There is lots of space throughout the beach so it never felt crowded. Beach chairs with umbrella are available for a small fee($2-5) and are recommended to have some shade from the hot sun. Perfect for an early morning jog or sunset stroll!

There were some hawkers strolling the beach but they were not too intense about you buying things. There was a good amount of beach between the umbrellas and the water for our kids to play in. The water was also shallow for a good distance to allow some playing without worry for our young children.

Negotiate with the umbrella men as they like to get hourly prices but you can get the whole day for not much more. There was some plastic in the water from time to time but it's hard to complain when the waves were as vigorous as they were.

A great beach with a reasonably shallow shelf so that even non swimmers can bathe comfortably. Evenings come alive with the music from several eateries with bean bags and chairs to enjoy the place. You may get a lot of salesmen peddling their wares but they are not at all persistent so not a bother. The sunsets are really great to enjoy with a beer or coconut drink alongside.

how poor I am, even every years take 2-3 times for visit Bali but it's my first time going to Seminyak Beach that only a few from Kuta. So, was a great place for enjoy the sunset and there's so many beach club there. If you want to some cheaper beach club, you must going to double six or Gado Gado beach next to Anantara Resort.

Perfect time for enjoy the Sunset is 17.30 to 19.00, but if you want get perfect seat at the clubs must going there before 17.00 would be crowd after that.

The beach is clean and good wave for surfing, or you can riding a horse. Soccer and made some sand castle must be awesome.

Will be back again

Initially, it is pretty stunning and the water seemed nice. It was a bit disturbing to have plastic things floating around and latching on to my feet. It was more than a bit disturbing to see that someone(s) had just left their smoked cigarettes smashed out on the ground like the beach was their private ashtray. I know that the locals are combatting this with clean ups and I wish them luck. It was cool to see young students interviewing foreigners for their English school. It is nice that the place has a pleasant wholesome vibe.

If cleaned up, and this means that also locals and tourist play their parts, this beach would be incredible.

Very disappointed in what is claimed to be a 'beach'. By Australian standards this beach doesn't even rate; ugly black brown sand, refuse constantly being raked up by locals, serious feeling of absolute filth. Vendors of sun lounges and umbrellas all distant cousins of Arthur Daly, but with a lot less tact. Slightest hint of rain and they tip you out their sun lounge to save them from getting wet, weird?

Today is is much better and there is hardly any rubbish but the last couple of days they have had trouble managing it, even though there was rubbish collectors and school children making big efforts to remove it.

Seminyak Beach was very disappointing, the beach is full of rubbish which is washed up everyday. In the afternoons you can see locals walking along the beach going through the rubbish, some were even taking dead fish!. The surf is dirty and rough not fit for swimming. Be careful when walking along this beach that you dont stand on something! The hotels along the beach are stunning and they do try and clean the areas in front of their hotels daily but it just washes up again the next day, very disapointing and sad to see such a beautiful place littered.

Yep, if you're visiting during wet season there will be rubbish on the beach. This washes down from all the creeks and rivers not just in Bali but across the sea and sadly lands on the S.W. facing beaches between Dec - March due to the currents.
If you visit at other times the beaches are quite lovely.

Try Googling The Great Pacific Garbage patch for truly depressing garbage information that is being created by all of us each each and every day.

There was a concerted effort during our recent stay to try and clean up the garbage and debris each day but this a mammoth task that also requires considerable resources.

So you wont perhaps be enjoying moonlit walks on the beach but the sunsets remain quite stunning and the beach is still a quick and easy gateway to some incredible dining and drinks options. Or visit between April and November !

Problem is litter. Our stay at Anantara Hotel meant we saw beach every day. Hotel cleaned it up each day but there were still plies of debris, eg wood and rubbish in heaps on beach. When you look into the water there is rubbish by the myriad and I'm not exaggerating. Plastic cups, bags, toys, bottles etc etc The pictures of pristine Bali beaches in Seminyak are not accurate.

My family and I visited Seminyak Beach because it was within walking distance of the Courtyard Marriott, but we regretted it. There was trash everyone on the beach, mostly due to the rainy season and currents drawing the trash out and the waves returning it to the beach. The locals did try to clean it but it was pointless, really, as the ocean regurgitated it minutes later. Go to Jimbaran if you want to enjoy the beach.

If you visit Seminyak, you MUST catch at least one sunset on the beach! Be sure to arrive about 30 minutes-1 hour before sunset as it can get crowded and things happen quite quickly. I sat near the Potato Head Beach Club along the shore and watched as the sun quickly sank behind the clouds. The colours were indescribable and the view was breathtaking! So amazing! The lucky people who live and work there get a treat like that everyday. I went during low-season so it wasn't too crowded. I highly recommend Seminyak Beach if you're in Bali!

Considering that the beauty of this place is the main asset, as a visitor, you are left in disbelief that the locals would allow this place to be spoilt by us. We hired surfboards and had a good surf, but this was definitely affected by the plastic bags and waste that wrapped themselves around our legs as we battled out into the surf..! If you choose to sit on the beach, then prepare yourself for one of the more committed examples of high-pressure selling that I have ever experienced, but I guess that goes with the territory. In a nut shell, probably best to go somewhere else for an unspoilt experience.

This was a much better place to chill out than Kuta beach. A much smaller crowd here which equated to a more peaceful time at the beach. At the same time, there were enough people to give it a lively feel (not deserted).

The waves here were pretty strong and surfing was difficult for a beginner like my friend and I. We were barely able to paddle out far enough to catch a wave without getting batted back (around the afternoon period).

There were also cafes and bars littered around the beach (unlike Kuta, where you had to get out of the beach) thus, it was very convenient to just grab a bite or drink. Definitely a much better beach to visit than Kuta.

Seminyak beach is a beautiful stretch of water with so every good restaurants along its shore including LaLucciola,Breeze and Ku DeTa. La Lucciola is probably the prettiest with great sea views and not much beach litter.As you walk back along the beach to main part of seminyak the beach litter bamboo poles and plastic litter is staggering. The water is unfit to swim in. It is equally dangerous for surfers with large pieces of wood floating or semi submerged which is really dangerous. Western facing beaches are subject to this after tropical storms with east coast beaches not affected as badly. The locals are trying really hard to control this pollution but much more needs to be done.

I have been to Nusa dua ( All five star property beaches) Sanur ( For those who dont like to enter the sea, but want to see the sea) Kuta ( Surfers and Kids jumping around, + Crowded) amongst the most tourist friendly beaches . I vote for Seminyak beach as this has all that a true Beach Connoisseur wants.
Quiet , Beach Chairs + Umbrella ( 25-30,000 ) per person per day if u bargain) cool beer , acceptable food like pizza or nasi goereng, fried rice) , soft sand , great waves and best views for Sunset.
You can walk in the evening on the beach from your hotel in Seminayak to Kuta or Legian beach and cross over to the Party side and restaurants in Kuta . The walk is 40 min and has great views.

There is hotel afetr hotel and bar after bar at this beach so it is seldom empty. The public entrances are few and far between but worth going there in any case. Spectacular sunsets and nice (if very, very warm) sand. Lot¬¥s of dealers walking along.

For swimming basically forget it. I am an experienced swimmer and within 5 days I managed to get in only twice, the waves are very good for surfing but not for swimmers.

And for all people not used to it: This red colour on somebody¬¥s elses skin may be the same one as the one on yours. Be aware.

White sand? Where? The sand is grey and dirty. If you try wallk in the water you want to make sure you walk at least ankle deep or you will walk on bits of rubbish, including what looked like condoms and needle covers. You cannot take a decent beach walk because streams run across the beach into the sea and they are of very questionable cleanness so you don't really want to walk through them in case of catching some illness. As for the bars, if you want to sit in big groups of people sitting close together, this might be your scene. I couldn't really see anything to rave about. There are much better places in bali than this.

This was by far the most disgusting beach I've ever seen. It literally looked like a garbage dump. The beach was covered in trash that had washed up from anywhere and everywhere.

Christmas and New Year are definitley a big hit in Seminyak, however don't expect clean beaches this time of year as the North winds bring in trash and wood from all over making it literally impossible to enjoy the beaches and the smell the garbage brings with it.

I visited in December, a week before Christmas and the beach wasn't filled with litters (maybe yet). The crowd generally sets in after 5pm, before that, the beach was less crowded and more serene. It was a rainy season but managed to catch the sunset on a good day. Street stalls are lined just outside the entrance to the beach, with the Satay tasting good.

Very nice beach with some hassles from people trying to sell you stuff non stop, although this is to be expected. The view is great so I recommend asking one of the locals selling beer if you can hire/borrow some chairs from them and then relax and enjoy the great service and cheap beer. The locals are very friendly and the beers go down a treat.

I've been to beautiful Bali many times over the years but this is the first time I've seen such a shockingly filthy beach in all my beach holidays across Asia. It is such a sad state Bali is in and what tourism has done to it.

Real drastic measures need to be taken urgently by the government, tourism industry and local communities to save the beaches of Bali.

We were expecting a relaxing beach vacation in Seminyak before we headed inland into Ubud. Sadly, the beaches in this area are extremely touristy and dirty. There is a lot of trash on the beach. You will also get hassled by vendors trying to sell you things as well as women who will just go ahead and start touching you wanting you to pay for a massage. If you are looking to relax on the beach with a good book and not be interrupted, this is not the beach for you. There are many nice restaurants and cafe's along this beach and it is fun at night when they all bring out their bean bags to have a drink. I would suggest to venture south to more beautiful beaches!

We came in Bali with big expectations for the beaches... And we found a very unpleasant place.
We spent some days on Seminik beach, including the New Year's Eve and we were totally disappointed with the DIRTY on the beach and in the water. You can find almost everything in terms of trash: from plastic to wood, from coconut shells to paper.
I am attaching some pictures, but they cannot describe the smell around.
Continuously, many local people are trying to sell you anything.
I am rating it 2 stars (and not only one) due to the electrizant atmosphere for the New Year's Eve: happy people, music and fireworks.
Overall, it was the worst beach I've ever seen.

we were in Seminjak after Christmas to new year. we were looking forward to some beach time and were utterly shocked to see the conditions. the beach, that would actually be nice, is totally full of waste. you can't go in the water as it is full of plastic and god knows what. if you lye on the beach it will be difficult to find a spot between the heaps of rubbish. it is absolutely shocking to see. hopefully it is being heard/seen and something is done. it looks like all waste is tipped into the ocean.

I was disappointed when we made the first trip on 29th to see the beach. But maybe because of the storm from previous nights, the beach really looked rundown.

But we went again on 31st to check it out and I was amazed. Perfect sunset view. And with the colorful bean bags scattered, it was very inviting. The motto "Beach, Bintang, Beer, Bali" was ideally correct.

Enjoyed the chill out music and company. You may be annoyed with the locals who are selling stuff like sunglasses, parios, snack food, paintings etc but hey without them the beach wouldn't be a colorful picture.

Will be coming back!

i've been to Bali a few times, this my first in the wet. If you're coming for a beach holiday avoid this time of year as the beach is gross. Other times it has been fine.

Still can't go wrong with a beer in the bean bags at sunset (when you can't see the trash)

We first approached the beach at Seminyak with excitement and anticipation only to be greeted by rubbish littering the sand and a fear that we might step on something dangerous! I couldn't help but think that if this is supposed to be one of Bali's premier beaches someone has to do something about the garbage. There were small groups of Oberoi staff gathering trash into little piles but it was an impossible task.....and so disappointing! I know we are spoiled for beautiful beaches in Australia but if Bali tourism is to be sustainable into the future, something has yo be done about the rubbish, recycling and environmental care.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,333,10>===============  
The beaches of Bali are awful and this one is no different. They are lowest common denominator tourist traps. The beach itself is dirty and polluted with garbage everywhere. If it rains or the wind blows onshore they seriously become like an garbage tip and you have to actually step over mountains of plastic. It's very sad to see the effect tourism has had here. It's kind of weird because millions of tourists come here, they sit there watching the sun set over the sea and they lounge about on the beach as though they don't even see the garbage. There is also polluted water that seriously smells like sewerage flowing into the ocean and kids play in it!! I'm from Australia and fortunately our beaches are still pristine paradise so I just don't see the attraction of Kuta and seminyak etc. I suppose some people live in some freezing grey part of Europe or some massive high rise in a polluted city and so for them just to see the ocean is an amazing expereince even if it is a filthy sewer. This beach is also lined by deck chairs which you must pay for if you want shade because they have built over where all the trees used to be. The guys who own the deck chairs will try to charge you ridiculous amounts of money but the going rate is about 50,000 per person. All along here from seminyak and further north there are Bars and warungs. They all play really loud music to drown out the neighbouring bars. We were going to eat dinner there and found the entire experience really annoying so we had one beer and left. I like music with dinner but I don't like it blasting and I don't like to hear 3 different musics from all directions. These bars also seem to be populated with pretentious people staring at their smart devices and taking selfies particularly 'la Plancha'. You're better off buying some bin tangs and go further up where there are no bars and enjoy the sunset on a towel with some quiet.

This is a very good beach. Could be great. The town effluent that runs into the beach is one big downer. Pretty sure that raw sewage is in that effluent river that runs between the Oberoi and the lifeguard station then another just south of Luna2.

Install a proper sewage system and change public dumping attitudes and this beach would be unforgettable.

Plastic, bottles, glass, crap in the sea and on the beach. Even the bars that rely on the beach for income have thrown dud glass lightbulbs onto the beach. Rivers flowing into the sea smell of suplhur. It needs huge effort now to make this a safe nice place to be. Don't come.

I went there with my husband for honeymoon and stayed at Yubi Villa. We went to seminyal beach around 6pm to see the sunset. It was pretty nice view. It wasour first time there. We were standing in the middle of the sand and suddenly a normal wave came in and we taught it won't reach us. But shockingly, it reach to our knee level.

I always enjoy a chilled Bintang on the beach at the bottom of Jl. Drupadi, so took a friends from L.A. to enjoy the sunset and general ambience. Very disappointing compared to previous visits. The beer wasn't chilled and when I told the 'beach boy', he just shrugged. Not to be deterred, we took our beers to the "Food Hut" for the mandatory Sate's, which were excellent.
However, when I went to pay the Bill they wanted to charge me for the beer TWICE! I pointed out that we ordered on the Beach, but carried them up the stairs to finish with our meal. One of the Waiters was adamant that he had given us a second beer with our meal. The "Cash desk" checked the 'chits' and of course, we had only had 1 beer each.
So, be aware...

Semniyak beach is full of life, with lots of beach facing bean bag joints having good food, drinks and live music. There are some vendors selling tatoos, cosmetics, trinklets, coconut water and offering massages. We walked from Semniyak beach to legian to kuta beach and Semniyak definitely seems cleaner and having better crowd, more limited to guests staying at beach properties. Kuta beach had lots of local people playing on the beach and stalls etc. so was much more crowded. Sea water is not that clean in Legian, Semniyak and Kuta. Waves are quite high but its still safe enough to go in the water waist deep or so...

What a horrible beach, it has so much potential but unfortunately looks like Bali tourism forgot about it. The beach was covered in rubbish and the sand was black with dirt.

Beautiful beach :) Perfect for a walk, big and not crowded.
When we went there the water came unexpectedly and take away my flip-flops from the sand, which were next to me - under the sun umbrella :D
After 2 hours we had to walk 5 mins to get into the water. The waves has been so big. It's great for surfers, but watch out, because there were few broken surfboards.
The sunset was the most beautiful I have ever seen. If you go there just for sunbathing don't miss it and wait to see it.

I'm not a beach person; I really prefer mountains anytime. Still, if there's a beach I don't mind spending time at, it'd be Seminyak in the low season.

It wasn't crowded but neither was it desolate. You could relax (once you've made clear what you wanted and didn't want from the vendors) but there's always a pulsating beat somewhere to remind you of partying.

And though none of the sunsets I saw was spectacular (it being cloudy in December), they were beautiful in their own ways.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,336,40>===============  
It's not the best beach in the world and could be cleaner though the hotels along it do clean up their bits but it's great for a refreshing breeze while walking in the sea to cool off. You can swim but the waves can be a bit strong.

I like long walks on beaches and Seminyak Beach is a place for me.
I like the feel of the wind in my face, the sand on my feet, and the sounds of the waves crashing in. Nice place for "me time or my time alone". Also nice to have friends to chat with.
A definite place to visit more than once.
The big plus factor is that the vendors are not aggressive and will not bother you once you say "no".

Seminyak beach is the cool beach in Bali! Along the beach you'll find a heap of trendy restaurants and bars where you can lay back on a beach lounge/beanbag and enjoy the sunset.

The sunset in Bali is just beautiful! And relaxing having a few drinks whilst watching the sunset was certainly a highlight for us!

We also enjoyed walking along Seminyak beach during the day. We did not swim at the beach as our hotel was in Legian so we swam further down.

This morning i walked on both directions of Seminyak beach and was truly shocked about so much dirt, trash, plastic bags and goblets, thousands of dead fish and dogs left overs etc.
Nobody really seems to care that the people here cut of the tree they are sitting on !
I have seen many beaches during my extensive travel life but this almost topped it all.

If the authorities would take only one dollar from each arriving tourist per day for the purpose of environemental clean up, instead of the stupid airport tax, they could buy as many of the beach cleaning trucks as they need.
The only clean parts of the beach were the ones managed by the more caring hotels. And even there, they had to clean it manually which is not so fun for the people that have to do it.
There are not trash bins anywhere. I was reading a comment about the rituals on the beach and i actually saw one which was nice to see. But after i returned to that arey, the people had left with tue usual trash piles. Dreadful !

They should remind themselves from time to time that tourists have choices and can spend their vacation and their money elsewhere very easily !

Its one of the finest stretch of beaches you see. A long picturesque beach with sufficient space for everyone to unwind. Its not crowded either.

Still its a piece of sheer beauty.

There's a sign at the beach apologising for the rubbish, which it says is a natural phenomenon occurring between December and March. I was here the first week of December, and it was covered in litter.

More gross still were the variety of fish and eel corpses that had washed up ashore in varying degrees of decomposition.

Walked along the beach a way and passed two waterway outlets running from the town to the sea, which ran black and smelled of effluent. The sand and water are dirty along much of it.

The caf√©s and bars along the beach look nice, but the music pumps so loudly from them, they're not a relaxing experience.

There are infinitely better beaches in much of the world, for sure.

Getting toward the end of my holiday I booked into a hotel close to the beach.
Walking along the beach in the morning staff set up umbrella's and lounge chairs, so colour full and people soon gathered.
I walked up the beach Ifound many bars/restaurants, all offering breakfast at good prices.
People watching was fantastic, travelling alone it's amazing what you notice.
around 5.30 I found myself down there for sunset.
Staff had changed the lounge sun beds foe bright coloured bean bags, flage and lots of lighting was getting put up. I choose a spot and relaxed, great people all around, so much happening, dinner was great, picked a different one each night, same same but different ... I would walk back up to my hotel maybe 10min and always felt safe. watching a sunset there at Seminyak beach I felt truly Blessed...

Beach was clean and easy to get 2,the traffic was some what scary when trying to cross road.The shops on eat street were amazing,so you always spent time checking out what was in store.

You can't beat this place for sunset drinks, the staff are always helpful and the cocktails are yummy.

i llove the view, and i love the dogs around there. It make it a most beautiful picture after all.............................

Liked how it wasn't crowded at all on the weekdays. We had space to ourselves and it was peaceful. Sand was fine and water clear.
Disliked how we had to pay to use a beach chair to park our things. Travel light. Bring a beach mat of your own.

very nice beach tidy and big waves..nice food in a local beach restaurant..you can have a bed there for 50 000 Rp/day (3,5 euro) near the local famous bar.

Very nice beach, much much cleaner than Kuta, more peaceful established crowd and less pesky vendors
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,338,40>===============  
Plenty of water activities. Bars and restaurants close by. Clean, organised beach. The usual beach hawkers but they don't hassle you. A polite no with a smile is all you need.

Much better than the over rated Jurian Bay, Loved the laid back and relaxed vibe, great fun with kids
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,339,40>===============  
Really pretty beach lots of bars and restaurants around...the sea is warm and sand I lovely. Lots of waves rolling in distance and amazing sunset. What can I say except heaven on earth... Sometimes ruined by screaming Australians.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,339,40>===============  
They are grading the beach each day so was nice and clean. They had flags to swim between if you are not a strong swimmer and the water was nice and clear. The sand is a little grey but not unpleasant.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,339,30>===============  
Nothing great was just like any other beach lots of people hassling you to come have a look at their stuff to buy
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,339,50>===============  
The surf here was good and safe for body boarding. The beach was clean and you could rent sun loungers off the local people for a reasonable price. They also rent boards and you buy extremely cheap beer from them. There are lots of sellers of sarongs, hats, watches etc, but most of them were not pushy!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,339,40>===============  
Warm gorgeous blue water. Shallow a long way out. While not the worst we've seen in our travels it is sad to see such a lovely beach with so much plastic and litter. "Hawkers" selling trinkets, ice cream, fruit etc were overall friendly. If you were not interested a simple but firm "no thank you" was sufficient. On average about 50,000 reps for beach chairs for 2 for two people the day.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,339,30>===============  
The beach was lovely but nothing out of the ordinary when compared to Australian beaches. It was lovely to sit in the restaurant and watch the sunset, but would not go out of my way to swim there.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,339,50>===============  
Plenty of space to walk and relax. beware of the waves though. at night the beach becomes a lounge. You'll see.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,339,40>===============  
Great spot for sunsets, but not ideal for swimming, strong current. There are many hotels you can go sit and enjoy the view along the walk or street vendors have set up lounges for you to lie on for a price.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,339,40>===============  
The beach has a breathtaking view of the sunset. It is a great place to relax. There are a lot of vendors approaching you trying to sell stuff, but they dont tag along once you refuse politely. A lot of restaurants along the beach are quite nice.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,339,50>===============  
the seminyak as many people know as the luxury villa located close to the beach, offered luxury items sell along the street, as the place as well location for many famous restaurant and resort, however many of the guest di di not know that the seminyak is the place for turtle sanctuary as the black sandy beach there are the home for green turtle nesting and sanctuary as well as laying their eggs
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,340,50>===============  
Wide expanses, great view and a few people but not much.. Hit the beach bars with music, bean bags and Bintang. Great service - you still get the odd sales person but who doesnt need a massage and hair braids
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,340,50>===============  
Hot, like everywhere. Plenty of places to sit and enjoy the heat if you are a sun lover. Beautiful sunset. Then nightlife on the beach. Is a must- live duet and beanbags, toes in soft sand. Love it!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,340,30>===============  
We arrived at 9am
Nobody on beach but some walkers and joggers
Our hotel has umbrella and lounge chairs so I am not sure about the price to rent
The beach is nice, fairly quiet but the locals approach you for pedicures and to sell their wares
They stand and stare at you even after you say no as if that will magically change your mind , that was bothersome if you just want to relax
I saw other people who were looking at a local's pictures he was selling and the others all swarmed this poor couple like bees to honey
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,340,50>===============  
The beach is honky tonky but you know that if you are coming to this beach. Lots of massage, and vendors always on top of you pushing their stuff. Great food, night life is good and people are in great spirits here. Just a fun place.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,340,20>===============  
All brown and yukky..didn't even go swimming...there were ppl annoying you to buy things everywhere and no signs or anything to show you where to exit the beach. Not good for kids at all.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,340,40>===============  
Pattaya beach in Thailand was disgusting and looking at some of these recent reviews I'm surprised. The sand isn't dirty it's just a different colour to Australian sand because it's rocks etc not yellow/white sand. I found myself right next to a lifeguard and multiple beach patrols. The waves are treacherous and swimming proficiency is a must. The beach was nice and the staff at the surf school were amazing and watched our bags while we swam. I didn't see any dogs, animals or rubbish while on the beach - didn't even find a single cigarette butt. November was a great month to come, was still sunny and almost deserted beach with almost nobody trying to sell things constantly. Water was lovely and not too cold but full of sand with no showers on the beach - that was the only disappointing part. Would recommend.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,340,50>===============  
Beach was very clean and able to walk miles along the beach. Need shoes or flip flops as the sand gets red hot. Surfers paradise but difficult if you are not a good swimmer. The hotel has a life guard on duty and warning flags are displayed on the beach
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,340,50>===============  
Basically there is Kuta to the south, Legian in the middle, and Seminyak beach to the north. Seminyak beach is the quiet one, although quiet is relative because in July/August it is also full of tourists. If you don't like crowded beach I suggest to visit in June like me, or September.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,340,50>===============  
Come at 5pm and feel the beauty of the sunset..really its amazing..you will meet alot of people there..swimming,surfing,jogging...
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,340,40>===============  
Good beach with lots of good quality cafes nearby for a snack or meal, and great spot to watch the sunset and have a quiet drink. Locals seem to like it too.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,341,40>===============  
Nice clean beach close to the major hotels/villas in Seminyak. Also, there are a fair number of dining options nearby. Chairs can be expensive, so make sure to negotiate them down, don't take the first offer.

Surf is rough, but there is a lifeguard. There were lots of people in the water, but should be careful with children or inexperienced swimmers.

Overall very good, but not the most picturesque beach, hence only 4 stars.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,341,10>===============  
It was alot cooler on the beach and its nice to see families playing here and the sunset was lovely however its dirty and the water is unclean . We walked along the beach to get to Ku de Ta and had to walk across 2 wide creeks that reaked of effluent.

The Seafood is average tasting, nothing fantastic about it. Wear sandals and use a decent toilet before going there.

The locals advised that Seminyak beach is a great place to catch the Bali sunset as compared to Kuta beach (if you have kids). It's just far less crowded and rowdy in Seminyak as compared to in Kuta. We went to Potato Head without reservations and couldn't get a table in time for the sunset so we gave that a miss and went to the beach instead.

Beaches on the west coast tend to be quite rough and many had flags out saying swimming prohibited. Lots of daybeds with umbrellas around to hire (about $2 or $3 AUS per day). Beach sands were mainly volcanic, nice and dark.

We had a fantastic view to watch the sun setting from Chez Gado Gado, while enjoying a couple of cocktails and snacks. We then walked along the beach and it was such a lovely spot, to see everyone was having a good time.

To many dogs running around doing their business. Even witnessed a guy taking a dump on the beach!!! Broken glasses, broken bottles a plenty. Maybe somebody should invest some of the money taken on entry and get those beaches cleaned up.

Just returned from Seminyak and visited the beach on a few occasions. We found it very nice and great for a relaxing drink at sunset.

Previous posters have commented that it was dirty. Yes the sand is sort of black but maybe that is it's natural hue. Dirty?......I'm not sure of that.

In saying that, we were only there from sunset for a few hours, and found it lively and very relaxing.

The beach is dirty. Near black sand and brown water. We didn't go in the water for fear of getting sick. Beach is polluted with rubbish. Not the White sand and clear water that we enjoy. Make sure your accommodation has a good pool instead. Or do a day trip to nusa dua or even better Dreamland.

The beaches along the coast of Seminyak are between Legian and Canggu. They are wide with great surf and mostly whitish sand. Not much in comparison with Australian beaches but great for a walk. Be careful with swimming outside a patrolled area as the rips can be deadly. There are many beach merchants so be prepared. Also there are some Warungs further up the beach that provide cheap Balinese meals in a great atmosphere.

I entered near the W hotel. I must admit I didn't go very far. To me it was not a beach where you lay down and sunbathe so was quickly of again

Great beach with lots of things to do and restaurants to eat at. It's also a bit quieter than Kuta. There are people constantly trying to sell you things, which can get annoying, but that's to be expected on a public beach. At night the beach side restaurants set up tables and bean bag chairs and there's also live music, it was great!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,345,50>===============  
Compared to the crowded Kuta beach, this beach is much better. The beach is quite peaceful, a nice place to stroll around or walk your dog. Might be a little crowded on the weekend since this is everyone's favorite place for jogging.

Most of the best hotels and Restaurants back on to the beach which is really fantastic. They are clean with plenty of access points. You can access the beech from most of the hotels as the security officers don't mind

Good beach for surfing, not so much to swim. It is good if you're in a club as well KuD√©Ta enjoying the view and enjoying the sound of the sea. Good beach for walking.

Never ever have we seen so many empty toothpaste tubes (???!!!) on the beach... Surf was beautiful but makes the swimming difficult, best swimming in pools. One of the destinations were there is no boulevard along the beaches, from where to admire the sea view.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,346,10>===============  
I only gave three stars to the sea swimming in Seminyak beach as the waves are very powerful and the currents are extremely strong. They have flags to mark the "safe" swimming areas although there's no life guard in sight, and given the ferocity of the sea currents, you get easily dragged out to the unsafe areas. I'd suggest, no swimming at all or keep at the shallow area- and if you still want to go deeper anyway, be VERY careful, unless you are at very good swimmer.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,346,30>===============  
I was here mostly at the end of the day just before sunset and the first day the Red Flag was up for the rough seas. The next day the sea was calmer but still if with children it is not really a calm sea for them to paddle in. The ambience is really great at the sun sets, with all the restaurants setting out pouffs and sofas on the sand and as the sun sets, lanterns are lit and some restaurants haves plastic tables that illuminated and change colours, quite quirky but all setting a nice atmosphere. Musicians perform at different restaurants and their songs mingle with the sound of the surf and carries along the beach. Vendors of patios, bracelets, kites, shish as walk the beach but do not annoy you, when you refuse to buy. The lights of the line of the coast can be seen and makes for a memorising evening.

A beautiful wide beach down to the sea. It's great for walking, catching some sun, or splashing through the water. Not too many hawkers and they are generally well behaved. The water can be rough with some undertow, so one has to be careful, and pay attention to beach advisories.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,346,50>===============  
This beach is so much better than Kuta. Less beach hawkers and better bars/restaurants. Watching sunset, drink in hand, sitting in a bean bag whilst listening to music is just heaven.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,346,20>===============  
Visited the beach around midday after deciding to walk down to Kuta. As we walked to the beach there were a number of open sewers running along the side of the back streets and when we got onto the beach one of them was running down the beach to the sea giving off an unbearable smell. We preserve only to find another runoff just 50m up the beach, again given a terrible smell. After that we gave up and decided it wasn't worth it. When you have such amazing beaches over at Sanur, why both with this one at all??

That said, the place looked like it had great surf and apparently the sunset is good so on that basis I have to assume its worth a couple of stars, otherwise I'd have given it zero as the competition is much better

Not the best beach I have been but it is a patrolled beach with lifesavers, lots of bars and restaurants, the usual touts selling their wares, massages etc. go just before sunset for spectacular sunset photos.

There are several smelly sewerage inlets into the sea which you have to paddle through as you walk down the beach. Beach sellers are persistent.

Plenty of paid sun beds to use, clean sand, plenty of snack bars. Lots of places not suitable for swimming due to red flags.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,347,30>===============  
While the sunsets are beautiful and the range of beach front bars and restaurants are great, the grey sand and violent waves (meaning swimming was prohibited while I was there) mean this is a fairly average beach for this part of the world. I have to add that I didn't see any of the litter many others had reported.

Don't get stressed by people selling things, they are just trying to make a living, massages are good. Enjoy the buzz and people watching. Negotiate hard, but in the end, dont worry about it. Have fun. La Plancha is esp[ecially good in the evenings. Obey the lifeguards / signs - the surf can be dangerous. Our neighbour died (drowned) off The Legion hotel beach

Very nice smooth shelf great for walking and dwelling, but pollution everywhere from urban wastewater drainages across it extension. If you‚Äôre too much in the water you‚Äôll get an ear infection or worse, which is a shame. It‚Äôs with a bitter taste that we realize how superb environments in Bali like Seminyak, especially in Southern areas, have been destroyed by pollution. Something definitely needs to be done to recover these areas.

Potato Head is one ... Ku De Ta is another place that is a must, especially at sunset, to eat, drink and take in a beautiful Bali sunset...

The sunset at the beach is beautiful. Get yourself a beanbag at one of the restaurants and kick back and relax. You'll be interrupted by locals selling you things but they leave if you aren't interested.

The water is unpredictable so not great for swimmers unless you are super confident or a surfer. In the morning it makes for a great walk and you could let the kids wet their feet at the shore break. Definitely have to visit whole you're there.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,349,50>===============  
I love this beach! So clean and the sand is soft so I didn't have to worry about stepping on stones or broken shells. If you want to have a swim go there by 3 pm that way you get some sun cause once it is dark you won't be able to swim. The current is strong so be careful. After swimming you can go to any of the shacks on the beach. There's a whole strip of places to choose from. Seafood is really good. Each place has its own band and vibes so just walk around and see which you like best before selecting. We enjoyed 'Chiringuito'.

There are a lot of hawkers that will sell you sarongs, bracelets etc. They are a bit annoying cause they come to you as soon as you sit at one of the shacks. Although they do have lovely stuff but you can get the same at a way cheaper rate in Padang Padang beach.

Its more of a younger crowd at the beach and a few kids. Great place to chill and end your night.

You cant go past this as a fantastic part of the beach to relax and enjoy the sun, the sunset or an evening meal. Restaurants that sprawl out onto the sand with bean bags to match make an evening drink and a bite to eat a memorable experience. This is what tropical holidays are supposed to be like ...

Seminyak beach is a really long stretch of dark sand, so don't expect the postcard white sands.... It is a lovely place to visit, however, even without the white sands. Head to the part further south in the direction of legian (but try to avoid legian itself if you can) near to the royal beach resort.. Then hire a beach bed for around 15000 and relax- the day we went there were plenty of interesting people heading back and forth along the front but it wasn't busy, just right... In the evening there are pleasant enough bars set on the front if you fancy that too.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,349,50>===============

The beach was pretty, had black sand mixed in with the white, was pretty clean. I only saw two pieces of rubbish among the half a km I walked. You can't sun bake in certain areas because they are sacred so look for the signs. There are many hotels you can go sit and enjoy the view along the walk or street venders have set up lounges for you to lie on for a price. You do get hassled by the locals a fair bit to buy their wares but they aren't too pushy. The water however was rough as guts, as an experienced swimmer I had difficulty going out further than my waist the waves were strong and they were churning up a lot of sand. The beach is patrolled by lifeguards.

The sand and beach aren't the best in Bali, but the sunsets are best and it's easy to learn to surf. Recommend paying for the chair/umbrella for the day and/or hanging out at one of the many beach bars to watch the sunset. Also, many options for surfing rentals and lessons.

Beautiful beach with huge waves. We loved walking along this beach everyday during our trip.
When the tide gets low the sand has a reflective glow and it is quite an amazing sight to behold. The sunsets were beautiful too. Most importantly there aren't any annoyingly persistent touts and vendors like what I've experienced in Kuta before.

We are a family who loving to visit Bali. We have visited Bali for three times.

Seminyak beach has amazing view especially when sunset moment.

I loved the mix of soft beige sand, with the soft black ash‚Ä¶ it created what I am calling tiger sand. The beach is lined up with lounge chairs that you rent from the locals. We found a spot in front of a cafe with awesome coffee, liquor selections, and smoothies so we were set for a whole day of relaxing at the beach. Even better, this cafe had Wi-Fi, so we could be sending photos to friends and making everyone jealous. We tried to get in some surf classes, but the swells were pretty high and we were beginners, so we sat on the loungers all day. Vendors are non-stop bombarding you with wares that they sell to tourists for a high price. Knowing this, I still ended up buying something for more than normal because he made me feel like I would bring him some luck for the day. We did walk the beach at a certain point after getting board of sitting out. Beware of the streams of water flowing out to the ocean, I don' know what it is, but I don't trust it. Also, be aware some beach area is on temple grounds so no one can lay out on it- its pretty obvious where those areas are.

Very strong waves meaning unable to swim freely. The beach itself was quite vast but fairly littered with debris (although in fairness, the locals made constant efforts to remove the washed up rubbish). A quiet beach though with sufficient peace to relax.

Coming from England but living in Australia, this beach fits somewhere in the middle.

The sand is not white but more grey, and there didn't seem to be much "dry sand".

There was plenty of sunbed (for a fee) and lots and lots of balinese people trying to sell you things. They can be pushy and annoying, but all you have to do is say no. We noticed one guy making fresh cocktails for people so maybe you wouldn't want to turn this one down!

The most beautiful thing about this beach were the waves, i've never seen anything like it before. Waves starting from so far back, it was so mesmerizing to watch.

I have to say that surfing there is awesome, as the breaks are big and you have a great time. Also the bars and cafes around are allright. on the other hand, the beach sometimes smells bad and there is some garbage around, homeless dogs also wonder around. If you are looking for good surf that's the place, but don't expect crystaline water and sand.

Good to spend some time. We saw lot of activities going around, lot of families playing together. It was good to see so much happening, with the cool wind at the sunset.

If entering by the temple, then choose the path by the square, not the alleyway, as there is waste water being drained from the hotel(?) straight onto the beach and into the sea water and you will have to walk through it to get to the quieter part of the beach. If entering by the square, take a left when you reach the beach as you will not experience the pungent smells from the waste water being blown in the wrong direction.

If hiring a lounge, don't pay more than 20000rph per person for a few hours.

Stay until sunset - worth waiting for!

A massive stretch of sand with a gentle gradient into the sea, lots of people surfing but not great for a swim. The hawkers on the beach become very wearing after a while as can't read a book or relax without someone trying to sell you something for more than about 10 minutes. Great place for a sunset but as are the number of bars and restaurants which overlook the beach and you can get a drink in these and not be hassled. A bit of little but seen much worse!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,356,40>===============  
This is a good beach for surf boarding and boogie boarding. Waves are high and give good momentum for a nice surf boarding experience. You will find many expert surfers riding on the waves. You will need to rent boards and seats. We had paid 100,000 rupiah for 2 hours for 2 boogie boards and 2 seats (got this rate after a bit of negotiation).

Also, if you come by bike, make sure to park your bike near to the area where beach is flatter and people are surfing. We had parked our bike closer to the area where resorts are located and beaches are steeper. And it was a long walk back (especially tiresome after the surf boarding session).

Don't forget to carry a sunscreen!

Our first beach in Bali, we loved its relaxed atmosphere, especially late afternoon. We enjoyed having a drink in beach warungs, laying in beanbags, watching people, sunset, the waves... our little daughter was running around, playing with other kids, enjoying the sand. It was perfect for the three of us. During the day was good ok, but a little difficult for small kids being in big waves.

Come to Seminyak beach for a sunset. Get here before 5pm and choose one of the many beach bars to plonk yourself down on one of the colorful beanbags, order some tapas and a Bintang and listen to trendy music while the sun goes down. Bali sunsets never fail to disappoint.

I was disappointed by the beach at Seminyak. Strong rip tide, Trash and an Algae bloom at the shoreline didn't make for good swimming or an enjoyable time at the beach. Coarse grey sand isn't really my thing either. I do recommend visiting any number of the beach clubs along the beach such as Ku De Ta and Potato Head. There are a lot of nice resorts on the waterfront, but I cannot recommend that you spent too much time on the beach itself.

The area of Seminyak was a great place to stay, and I would stay there again. Having been to so many other beaches in South East Asia, I was disappointed - my expectations were unrealistic.

If you like white Sandy beaches, try out Nusa Dua, or even the pristine ones out by Jimbaran or Ungasan.

I will not return to this beach. If it weren't for the accommodation I would have left earlier.
The beach is covered in litter.
The noise from the big bars is annoying and I could not enjoy my walk because I just saw one after the other white fat burnt tourist bargaining over $1.00 for sarongs and other cheap & nasty tourist crap.
Then there is the ever present G4S security circling the bars making me feel unsafe. Never again.

Average type beach, Personally i would perfer Kuat beach although Seminyak is alot quieter it is alot dirtier with rubbish and broken glass frequently seen along the beach/waters edge.

The beach in Seminyak tended to be crowded in spots, but it is a nice beach for walking and for dipping into the water. One really can't swim there because of dangerous rip tides.

Seminyak Beach is a very nice beach in Bali. Great to walk along - you can walk down to Kuta and for stunning sunsets since it is on the West side of the island. Housing many numerous hotels, restaurants and bars, Seminyak is somewhat more sophisticated than its sister Kuta. It has a decent stretch of whitish sand, and the water is okay. Currents could also be strong so be careful when you swim in here and respect all instructions from lifeguards and the hotel staff. Cool beach to hang out on and watch the surfers do their thing.

As we came into the beach area, we could see red flags i.e. strong current signs at various intervals...it was 9am in morning and there was a good cool breeze and chilly water...
Beach was fabulous and the strong waves encouraged me to try Surfing for the first time. I couldn't balance much in 2-3 hrs of time, but really enjoyed the strong waves and fabulous surfing type experience...
My son, was engrossed all time with the waves and dark sand mountains...
If you are not in surfing, just relax, enjoy the quiteness and view one of the strong wave beaches in Bali..the strong Indian ocean waves
Highly recommended if you are in Kuta area
Just take care when you rent a seat / place to sit...check that the person has water supply working...else you will feel a shock with salty water sticking your body and far away places to wash it down ...

The beach is an open expanse of water, running many kilometres in each direction. Care must be taken as there are sand bars close to the beach causing rips and second waves which casual swimmers will find hard.
The surf is close to the beach, forming and closing only 50 metres from the water edge, yet allows the wave to run all the way to the sand. So allows beginner surfers some opportunity to catch smaller sets to get on board and enjoy.

This is by far the best beach we saw in Bali. The beach is clean and you can see people enjoying walks and the health conscious ones running along the long stretch of white sand.

This beach is located on the north beach of Kuta. From Kuta, Legian and Seminyak you can reach on foot. Its atmosphere is almost the same as Kuta, except for its location a bit far from the bustle of Kuta, Legian and Seminyak beach visitors not as much as the beach of Kuta. You can also do the activity that goes on Kuta beach. Swimming, sun bathing on white sand, surfing, playing football on the coast, also enjoy the panoramic view at sunset.
Interestingly, in all the way to the coast line stand Seminyak restaurant that offers dishes that tastes so Yummy, from low price to expensive price and also there are a plenty of luxury beach club, of the traditional dishes to international cuisine. That why the street called eating street.

Found this to be the best beach around the Kuta area, although always busy. Our 1st day was perfect, great waves for body surfing. But then our next 3 visits it was way to rough and rips everywhere, I would have to say if in Australia the beach would have been closed.

But all in all if you are staying in the area it is a good option. We personally liked the more southern beaches which did have white sand, here the sand is a grey colour.

This main stretch of beach running across Seminyak-proper is home to dark sand and a considerable amount of rubbish. Unfortunately there are a number of creeks and storm-water drains that empty onto this vast area, meaning refuse, pollutants and excrement flood onto the sand in places.

While there are [visibly] some good waves on offer, and there are a few restaurants/bars/clubs opening onto the beach, this would be one to be avoided. There are many options available on the island, and - coupled with the persistent 'salespeople' offering a variety of beach-side up-sells (e.g. board-hire, sun-bed hire, trinkets) - this is not a good one.

Along the 2km stretch of beach at Seminyak, there are about 5 or 6 storm water / creeks that flow into the ocean. They are all polluted with rubbish and raw sewage. the stench is disgusting and the unless you're a surfer on a board and can paddle out, swimming in that is asking for dysentery. The council / government really needs to invest in proper sewerage treatment otherwise tourists are just not going to come back.

Go to south to Balantan or much further north to swim in the brochure / website photos or swim in your own villa's pool.

At a very busy season like the end of June to August, Seminyak beach is still better than Kuta as it's lee crowded. You can find many sun beds by the beach with paying 50k for a pair of them. Many sellers (accessories to masseuse) will prob come over to where you sit to offer their stuffs. You can avoid this in the evening (about 4 pm and after) when the cafes by the beach are open, you can sit in the bean bag for free (just order some drinks or food, ofc). The beach itself, you can deft learn to surf there as it is flat and good for beginner. The sand - unlike the description here in TA - is black sparkling volcanic sand instead of white. Sunset is quite nice here.

The sunset here is breathtaking and there are many places along the way you can see it. Staying away from the stalls on the beach is highly recommended. There are many very famous bars along the beach which have great food and music. But be aware some require men to wear t-shirts and not singlets.

Easy to get to, goes for miles and there's restaurants/bars every few feet to dip into when you need a bite to eat or drink. Renting an umbrella and a chair is a must. Be warned, you will be harassed by locals selling goods all day.

So my friend and I explored seminyak, nusa dua, jimbaran beaches... And we concluded seminyak was the best, the waters were the cleanest and clearest, and with the restaurants by the beaches to chill out to it was the best. The others were dirty with litter and part of isolated and boring areas.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,365,50>===============  
As we stayed in Seminyak the beach was just a 5 minute walk from our hotel. We decided to go there to catch the sunset. And on the day we went, it was a beautiful low tide with the sunset reflecting on the wet sand. it was the most beautiful scenery i ever captured! And as most of the tourists were at the beachside bars and restaurants it was not crowded at the water at all. Probably it wasnt safe too. But i just wanted to wet my feet by the shore and i could do that for a short while before the waves got a bit wild and i moved out! Best place to go to if you want to capture some nice sunset.

Relaxing and beautiful scenery. Great for surfing and sun bathing. Beautiful long sandy beach, Fresh air and can be romantic place and Scenery for honeymooners :) great place to visit
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <7,365,40>===============  
Seminyak beach is a surfer's beach and not really for swimming. The waves can be huge and the undercurrent strong. During low tide, you can probably walk out quite far in waist deep water although the waves might still knock you off your feet.

There are a number of peddlers but this is no where near as annoying as the ones you find in Samui or Phuket. The great thing about the beach is there are no parasailing or jet ski operators spoiling the beach with noise and gasoline. You could just lay a beach towel on the sand, or pay private operators to rent a padded lounge chair and umbrella which is what we did in the end. It's a lot more comfortable for a few dollars an hour.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,365,50>===============  
there are many places to eat, have drinks, view the sunset and have a massage. You do get asked to buy on the beach but it's not intrusive and will leave you alone if you say no. Everyone's really so friendly

Spent majority of our time in Seminyak on this beach.. Perfect place to grab breakfast at one of the beach bars watching the sea/surfers.. Then sunbathe on a bed which is next to nothing in cost.. The option of surfing is there but if you don't want to you can go in the sea without being bothered by surfers.. At about 5pm all the large bean bags come out and umbrellas with lights ready for sunset with a couple of bars playing music. It was perfect to grab a couple of drinks and some tapas on the bean bags watching the sun go down..

Now I have read some reviews about this beach being dirty and seen the pictures too. It really has to so with timing your visit. Apparently, in the winter the currents bring tones of trash that has been churning across the sea and dumps it on the beaches in large quantities. When I visited in June, the beaches were very clean. From the end of May until November, I am told, is the best time to visit. Even so, I witnessed beach cleaners through out the day, cleaning the sand of things not just washed up, but things left by beach goers. We have to be responsible visitors, too. There was very little litter, that I could see and I spent two entire days there.

There are people trying to sell you things, but hey, it's a living. You can say no, put on head phones, stick your head in your book, or juts ignore them. I rented a chair for the day, and had a great time. If I wanted fresh pineapple, a cool drink or a sarong, someone would be by to offer one for sale. I would recommend giving it a try.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <2,366,30>===============  
wide open beach, however open sewer nearby which flows straight into the sea, so you MUST swim upstream. Usual litter prevails, not so blighted by hawkers

When the tide is up, there is no beach sand to stay so you HAVE to rent chairs or beds, there is also too many people trying to sale fake goods, bracelets and more.

The restaurant with bean bags on the sand had great food and for $3 per bag, you can stay all day. The surf is good, if a little dangerous. So many Aussies, thought we were at Lorne!!

Not a very clean beach with broken glass and many dogs running along in groups. Also does not look too safe in the ocean. I would not recommend thinking this will be a beach holiday. Unless you are looking at it from a poolside seat in one of the hotels opposite!

I have to say, I wasn't impressed with Seminyak Beach. I just can't put my finger on it. Was it the putrid sand, the litter strewn from one end to the other, the broken glass? I even saw a guy with a dog throwing a light bulb into the ocean for the dog to retrieve, yep - a lightbulb!. Of course on one toss it broke and sunk for some unsuspecting person to cut their foot open on.

It's not even pretty to look at, and doesn't compare to the thousands of golden beaches we have here in Oz.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <9,366,20>===============  
We sat here about 3 times- just outside KUDeTA. The life guards were never watching the water - probably because the flags were never up thus we weren't allowed to swim here. The people with the chairs and drinks stand were horrible- prices changing daily and they constantly wanted to know when you would be moving on. Kudeta is great therefore we started sitting on the lounges and ordering our drinks- much better than sitting on the beach. Better service and environment
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <10,366,40>===============  
me and my friend stayed for only 5 days in bali for a short holiday that we desperately need..we have planned to visit many beaches therefore we rented a car for those 5 days so that its convenient to travel there..
we stayed around seminyak, so the first beach to go is to seminyak beach..we went for jogging in the morning and it was very nice...clear blue sky, soothing morning breeze, calming sounds of the ocean, fresh salty air, dogs and their owner running and playing happily, a couple with their 2 years old son having a morning walk, its all just a perfect way to start your day...
and after going around shopping and had lunch around 3 p.m we already back to relax and watch the sunset..and we were lucky because the weather is good and there's no cloud..sunset is amazing..(i will put also pictures here)..and then just right after the sun is down there's a nice live music, we wanted to stay just for an hour but we ended up there until 9 pm..it was a very relaxing place...good music, sand in between your toes, and romantic lights...
we were enchanted by the place and the next thing we know was for those 5 days we didn't visit any other beaches (screwed our plans) ..maybe it sounds boring, but we get what we are looking for in bali...a relaxing holiday..
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <1,367,40>===============

i love seminyak better than kuta beach. because it's not as crowded as kuta. it was breezy and calm. i spent my entire evening here, from 3 to 7 PM. i cant swim, so the red signage flags--that given warn about swimming prohibited area--didn't affect me at all :D
they rent the chair (and the umbrella) for approximately IDR 50.000 - IDR 70.000. and it was sooo cozy.

imo, truly a perfect place to see sunset.

The seminyak beach is much better than kuta (not overly crowded) just relax, sip coconut water...dont fall for the massages they offer at the beach. try bakso...it's great. the sunset is also beautiful.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <6,367,30>===============  
Red flags mark areas off- limits to swimmers because of dangerous tides. We also were concerned by polluted water flowing into the ocean at several points. One must cross through these foul smelling streams to keep walking along the beach. otherwise, great for surfers. Best to go to beach clubs along the water.

A lovely flat beach several kilometres long to amble along, in early morning or late afternoon you'll see the beautifully styles fishing boats being pushed out into the waves - quite a sight. In the evening restaurants spread accross the beach, fish is really good. Make sure you haggle, if in a group a plate of various fish and shell fish is good value and they'll usually discount. Use anti-bug spray on legs and ankles to avoid bites - not a huge problem but common on sand.

I guess coming from Australia it's hard to find good beaches compared to what we have back home, however I was truly shocked at the state of Seminyak Beach. The rubbish was piled up on the beach, mostly plastic bottles. The water was filthy as well with rubbish in it. I couldn't believe people were actually swimming and sunbathing on the beach. I will not be returning, there are much better beaches, cleaner beached around Asia.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <5,368,40>===============  
This is a very clean beach and great for just lying down to tan, surfing, or even renting a beach chair with umbrella. The downside would be hawkers trying to sell various things (shades, shawls etc.) to you while you're lying on the beach. There are little bars selling food like sandwiches, desserts and drinks along the beach too.

This was actually my favourite beach in Bali (including Lombok and Gillis). It is wide and long, beautiful views. You can sunbath anywhere you fancy or hire a sun lounger for 100,000 for the full day. Lots of nice cafes and it is hive of activity in the evening with many many nice restaurants. Also worthy of note is that it is an excellent surfer beach, for beginners or professionals! The waves break quite far out giving you a really long surf back in.

We know Bali is not about beaches only, but we found Seminyak Beach very average. We have been to many more scenic beaches in many different countries. But if you want a place to sit at a beach side caf√© and relax for a few hours, it does the trick. I would not recommend going in the water, though.

The day we went the beach was quite clean, there hadnt been any rain the week we were there so i guess we were lucky. This definately isnt a white sand beach, its the regular black/brown sand you find in legian/kuta as well. There is plenty of places to eat along the beach and plenty of sun lounges to rent, we paid 10k for two for the day. The water is nice, there are plenty of waves, but its not a real good place for kids or the inexperienced to swim, there are several big rips and a strong current. While we were there 2 guys got pulled out the back behind the waves while everyone sat around and watched, there are no lifesavers here, eventually someone swam out to help them swim back in. You dont get hassled as much here as you do in Kuta but there are still plenty of hawkers walking the beach, but its bali and u come to expect that. Overall its an ok beach for a days swimming and people watching but i wouldnt recommend it for young kids or inexperienced swimmers, stick to sand castles

As with all the beaches north of Kuta,forget about golden sands,forget about clean beaches forget about clean swimming.
Unless you are staying at a top hotel,the condition of the beach is totally reliant on the previous high tide.The beach will either be spotlessly clean or littered with so much rubbish you would be inclined to think you are wallowing in a rubbish tip.
And the ocean at times is not fit for swimming with oil slicks polluting the water and the sand.
Given all that negativity,to walk in the sort of serenity that a sunset beach provides is more than relaxing and the sunsets can be awesome.

So if you like strolling on the beach at sunset, or enjoying extended beachside lunches, Seminayak is the place to be. The beach is wide and the surf is good if you have the skills. Swimmers are advised to only swim between the red and yellow flags, not where there are red flags, due to the rips or large waves. There is a good choice of beach bars, clubs and restaurants for day or night-time entertainment. Good for people watching. Can be windy though.

We spent late afternoon and early evening at this beach. Mixed feelings. The water and sunset were stunning. The view of the beach was very disappointing. There was garbage all along the beach.

This probably isn't a well warranted review, based on experience, but here goes! We walked to Seminyak Beach from our villa in the Jalan Kunti 1 area (near to Bali Deli), the first night we arrived to Bali. We've been here a month - give or take - and I have not returned. Early evening, and it's about a 20 minute, winding walk through the streets of Grosinyak to get there. We arrive to find, not so much a beach, but more akin to a newly started landfill. Plastic, garbage, washed up debris of all sorts, littering the beach and floating in the water. Not exactly a Kodak moment! And yet - swimmers, surfers and sun worshipers galore! I guess it's that "when in Rome" mentality? (I'd rather just go to Rome!) Oh wait! I lie! We did walk the beach a second time during a pouring rain storm, which was a million times better as there were only a handful of folks around, and clean-up crews were hard at work which was great to see, but limited to the beach-fronts of the fancy hotels. My concern on that day - what the hell is hiding in that grey water that flows from the klongs - directly in to the sea??? Shameful!

I have been to many beaches all over the world, and this one is pretty special in its own way.
Although the sand are pretty dark and looks like mud when its wet, but the reflections at about 6 to 7pm were beautiful! You can see your own reflections or even those of the clouds when the tide is low. Probably one of the more beautiful beaches in the world (when there's not too many people).

Visited this beach one time only during our recent stay a few hundred metres up the road. Terrible experience.
Upon approaching the beach we were instantly bombarded by local women trying to braid our hair and sell clothing etc. They were extremely pushy and would not take no for an answer and grabbed my daughters hair and started to braid it expecting to be paid. And they were way over priced. But get sucked in. The beach was dirty and not a pleasant place at all. I definately would not swim in the water.

The beach is full of toxic garbage coming from the city with the rain flow. Others say that they come from the ocean from the fishing boats.

I can't believe how much crap there is on this beach - mostly plastics. Sometimes you'd see people scraping it up, but not enough to make much of a difference.

Good for surfers though - nice breaks.

As lovely as the weather was in Bali last week, the one thing I just could not stay silent about is how dirty the beach was. There were rubbish that formed a tide line here on Seminyak, and also along Kuta. It was such an eye sore. And worse, true to its name, there were oil slicks coming in with the waves. Seminyak in bahasa means "one oil". I guess Bali really didnt want to disappoint. If you want the beach, go elsewhere. Heard Sanur is far better...or even Nusa Dua....or anywhere else, but...

But if you dont want the beach, then why even go to Bali? I just had the misfortune of not doing enough research about the island. Probably deluded by the many glorified romantic tales - blame eat pray love for that! But if you seek to just chill and unwind, then, this island is ideal. And this part of Kuta (contrary to popular belief, Seminyak, Legian and Kuta is in reality ONE area) is the quieter portion.

Food wise? For Asians, it's not really value for money at all. Drinks are rather pricey too. Shopping for the ladies? Sure...Bangkok's cheaper. Heck, even KL is far cheaper. Nightlife? In Seminyak? They only have 2 options, apart from dinner. One is the high end restaurants-turn-club-after-dinner, the other...well, if you dont swing the other way, and do not like diva shows, then hail a cab and hit Jalan Legian, Kuta instead.

But the one thing I enjoyed Seminyak for was the hospitality at the hotel and restaurants I went to. But probably an advantage that I can speak Indonesian.

The beach is wide and flat and the water is warm. The sand can get hot, however. On this side of Bali the rip current (undertow) is quite strong so be very careful when swimming.

A tide line of rubbish stretching from Seminyak to Kuta with dogs fouling on top of the trash. When it gets windy more rubbish blows in from Java, which covers the beach in bottles and plastic.

very beautiful beach we could enjoy the sunset while enjoying a cup of tea in the cafe. Only five minutes from our hotel stay.

Please be very careful swimming at this beach very strong rips. We were there on the Saturday and a girl nearly drowned the lifesavers did not spot her straight away however another surf board rider came to her rescue they had to resuscitate her and then off to the hospital she was not looking very good. Another man went in after her and he had to be helped back in from the Lifesavers as well if not for their efforts I feel both would have drowned - well done to those who helped.

The views are great here, you can have a quiet stroll without bumping into too many people like Kuta for example. The only thing I disliked was that even in this part of the beach, which is supposedly the most upscale, there are still small patches of garbage seen on the sides.

Nice place to catch a beach offering ceremony in the morning, with local men and women coming from the nearby Pura Petitenget.

Nothing special about the beach to be honest... many people were there but it wasn't really clean or pretty to begin with. The nearby areas are very crowded.

Worse beaches I have ever winessed and I have visited more than 70 countries. Paradise Bali is not! Rubbish is all over the beach. Some of it piled up for the tide to take it out and hey presto...bring it in again.

Beautiful position and setting, We go there every time we are in Bali and have not been disappointed yet. An oldie but a goodie!

The beach was clean and the water was nice although compared to other beaches in Bali it wasn¬¥t as clear, but it could have been the tide. There where a lot of people there when we went, so it wasn¬¥t as enjoyable as it could have been.

A must for a romantic dinner in seminyak! Great food and service overlooking the beach! Highly recommended!
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <3,375,30>===============  
Great beach but with one of the polluted rivers ending here and the growing amount of people simply no good for me.
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <4,375,40>===============  
The beach is great place just to laze around, it is really quite clean probably due to the Seminyak area. There are only a few people trying to sell their goods and they are respectful leaving you once you have said "no thank you".

Went there in the evening, great view of the sunset, nice breeze as you see couples and families enjoying themselves, plus it a 10 mins walk away to Ku De Ta!

Unlike the kuta beach which is dirty and crowded most of the time, you can expect a peaceful, clean and quite beach. A good place for a walk and some self-serenity. Definitely worth the visit if you need some relaxation

Reasonably clean. Nice to walk along this beach. When tired, you can stop at any of the cafes lining the beach. Especially like sunsets at La Lucciola Restaurant
=============<no,pageNo,rating> <8,375,30>===============  
Quieter clean end of the waterfront, but be prepared to be hassled by vendors selling you all sorts of knick-knacks. Stay firm, they'll go away after 15 mins!

Sad to say the beaches along Seminyak are looking more polluted than ever with what appears to be human waste in the water.
La Lucciola has a nice location but when you arrive at Seminyak's main beach opposite Cocoon you can see a big brown tide of sludge in the already brown water.
The storm water drainage at many points along Seminyak's beaches into the ocean looks as though you may contract something if you come in contact with it.
